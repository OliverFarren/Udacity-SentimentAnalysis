# Udacity-SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment Analysis Model using LSTM - developed during the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

This guided Project looks at building a Sentiment Analysis Model using LSTM to predict whether the sentiment of a moview review is positive or negative.

The final model was tested on a test dataset using an sklearn accuracy score and had a final accuracy of 83%

This project was the culmination of the Machine Learning course that explored building and deploying several XGBoost models in Amazon SageMaker using clean datasets.

Key learning outcomes:

- Build a corpus of words from a series of text files
- Building a simple PyTorch model and deploying as an endpoint in SageMaker
- SageMaker resource management 
- Connecting the deployed model to a REST API through AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda.
