/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<hr>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.</p>
<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Instructions">&#182;</a></h2><p>Some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this notebook. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '<strong>TODO</strong>' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a <code># TODO: ...</code> comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!</p>
<p>In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '<strong>Question:</strong>' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '<strong>Answer:</strong>' header by editing the Markdown cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> keyboard shortcut. In addition, a cell can be edited by typically clicking it (double-click for Markdown cells) or by pressing <strong>Enter</strong> while it is highlighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="General-Outline">General Outline<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Outline">&#182;</a></h2><p>Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download or otherwise retrieve the data.</li>
<li>Process / Prepare the data.</li>
<li>Upload the processed data to S3.</li>
<li>Train a chosen model.</li>
<li>Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).</li>
<li>Deploy the trained model.</li>
<li>Use the deployed model.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications.</p>
<p>First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.</p>

<pre>Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a terrific new comedic duo. &#39;Noriyuki Pat Morita&#39; is a very funny man, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a &#39;proto type&#39; turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat&#39;s character collides with &#39;Jay Leno&#39;s&#39; character, a fast talking&#39; but down to business-player type Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the honorable &#39;Ways&#39; of Japan meet the all-out old school Detroit police investigative &#39;Ways&#39;. The two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a &#39;rythym&#39; that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team, that solves the case, cold. After battling a city crime boss for the stolen &#39;equiptment&#39; and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. A little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing. I rated this a 9. Lewis&#39;s direction makes&#39; this a near perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I recommend it highly.(***)

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Above we mentioned that <code>review_to_words</code> method removes html formatting and allows us to tokenize the words found in a review, for example, converting <em>entertained</em> and <em>entertaining</em> into <em>entertain</em> so that they are treated as though they are the same word. What else, if anything, does this method do to the input?</p>

<p>The method below applies the <code>review_to_words</code> method to each of the reviews in the training and testing datasets. In addition it caches the results. This is because performing this processing step can take a long time. This way if you are unable to complete the notebook in the current session, you can come back without needing to process the data a second time.</p>

<h2 id="Transform-the-data">Transform the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Transform-the-data">&#182;</a></h2><p>In the XGBoost notebook we transformed the data from its word representation to a bag-of-words feature representation. For the model we are going to construct in this notebook we will construct a feature representation which is very similar. To start, we will represent each word as an integer. Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently. We will then combine all of the infrequent words into a single category and, in our case, we will label it as <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Since we will be using a recurrent neural network, it will be convenient if the length of each review is the same. To do this, we will fix a size for our reviews and then pad short reviews with the category 'no word' (which we will label <code>0</code>) and truncate long reviews.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">(TODO) Create a word dictionary<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">&#182;</a></h3><p>To begin with, we need to construct a way to map words that appear in the reviews to integers. Here we fix the size of our vocabulary (including the 'no word' and 'infrequent' categories) to be <code>5000</code> but you may wish to change this to see how it affects the model.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TODO:</strong> Complete the implementation for the <code>build_dict()</code> method below. Note that even though the vocab_size is set to <code>5000</code>, we only want to construct a mapping for the most frequently appearing <code>4998</code> words. This is because we want to reserve the special labels <code>0</code> for 'no word' and <code>1</code> for 'infrequent word'.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>There is no problem with useing these methods on both the training and test sets.</p>
<p>The functions are converting the words in each review into integer values based on the word_dict that was calculated from just the train data. The test data had no influence on building the word dict.</p>

In particular, a model comprises three objects</p>
<ul>
<li>Model Artifacts,</li>
<li>Training Code, and</li>
<li>Inference Code,</li>
</ul>
<p>each of which interact with one another. In the XGBoost example we used training and inference code that was provided by Amazon. Here we will still be using containers provided by Amazon with the added benefit of being able to include our own custom code.</p>
<p>We will start by implementing our own neural network in PyTorch along with a training script. For the purposes of this project we have provided the necessary model object in the <code>model.py</code> file, inside of the <code>train</code> folder. You can see the provided implementation by running the cell below.</p>

<p>The important takeaway from the implementation provided is that there are three parameters that we may wish to tweak to improve the performance of our model. These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.</p>
<p>First we will load a small portion of the training data set to use as a sample. It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving.</p>

<h2 id="Step-5:-Testing-the-model">Step 5: Testing the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-5:-Testing-the-model">&#182;</a></h2><p>As mentioned at the top of this notebook, we will be testing this model by first deploying it and then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">Step 6: Deploy the model for testing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code> where <code>review[500]</code> is a sequence of <code>500</code> integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using <code>word_dict</code>. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.</p>
<p>There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called <code>model_fn()</code> and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the <code>model_fn()</code> method from the <code>train.py</code> file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> )</p>
<p>Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until <em>you</em> shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.</p>
<p>In other words <strong>If you are no longer using a deployed endpoint, shut it down!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The performance of the LSTM is about the same as the updated XGBoost model which has an accuracy of 0.83.</p>
<p>I would expect LSTM to perform better since it used word embedding to represent reviews whereas XGBoost uses a bag of words method which doesn't take into account information held in the word order.</p>

<p>The question we now need to answer is, how do we send this review to our model?</p>
<p>Recall in the first section of this notebook we did a bunch of data processing to the IMDb dataset. In particular, we did two specific things to the provided reviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed any html tags and stemmed the input</li>
<li>Encoded the review as a sequence of integers using <code>word_dict</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In order process the review we will need to repeat these two steps.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Using the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> methods from section one, convert <code>test_review</code> into a numpy array <code>test_data</code> suitable to send to our model.

<p>As we saw above, by default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.</p>
<p>We will store the code that we write in the <code>serve</code> directory. Provided in this directory is the <code>model.py</code> file that we used to construct our model, a <code>utils.py</code> file which contains the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and <code>predict.py</code>, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that <code>requirements.txt</code> is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.</p>
<p>When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_fn</code>: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.</li>
<li><code>input_fn</code>: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.</li>
<li><code>output_fn</code>: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.</li>
<li><code>predict_fn</code>: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the <code>input_fn</code> and <code>output_fn</code> methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.</p>
<h3 id="(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">(TODO) Writing inference code<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">&#182;</a></h3><p>Before writing our custom inference code, we will begin by taking a look at the code which has been provided.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The default behaviour for a deployed PyTorch model is to assume that any input passed to the predictor is a <code>numpy</code> array.

b&#34;This movie is a mystery. It&#39;s not scary, it&#39;s spooky. You&#39;ll probably jump at some points and for some of it you&#39;ll be scratching your head to figure it out. It unfolds its mystery through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum, Don. He needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother, and once Eve agrees to help him, she completely opens up pandora&#39;s box and unleashes some very strange things, including Malachi. I won&#39;t go into Malachi, but I thought the way that played out was complete genius. I know movie buffs won&#39;t regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesn&#39;t have anyone very famous in it (Angelina Jolie&#39;s brother was excellent, but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition) but I do think the way the Malachi ending works is something to talk about. I&#39;ve recommended this to my friends, definitely worth the purchase or rental price.&#34;
b&#34;I have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto. the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace. it was amazing, the choreograph was excellent as well as most of the visual effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the story line is something new to naruto. but it is basically the same as the first movie. in the series u see them fight against other ninjas,but in the movies (1+2) u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction. it is nice to see them fighting something other then ninja, and that it was great to see some other power other then chakra. and how other people from other land across the ocean fight. also sakura finally killed someone that is more stronger then her. (she have truly become strong) it was a lot better then the fillers on the series that i&#39;m watching now. when u watch this movie the fast action scene will surely make your heart pound. With new jutsus and garra in the movie, u know it is good. and the music was good as well, but i find it to be lacking something. But the ending theme song was a plus. (dind dong dang) i think was a really good song. I totally recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all i give this movie a 10, because i just love it. if u do decide to watch it, enjoy it. lol&#34;
b&#34;Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in France with family and friends, when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle located in Scotland. Gerald&#39;s uncle reportedly has fallen ill and has requested Gerald, the sole heir, be present. Gerald goes off to Scotland, leaving his future bride behind. A few weeks pass and he doesn&#39;t come back. Concerned, Kitty sends out telegrams but doesn&#39;t hear back from her fianc\xc3\xa9. Four more weeks pass and Kitty finally receives a weird response from Gerald, calling off the engagement and telling her to move on with her life. Not ready to give up on her relationship and looking for answers, Kitty hops on a plane and decides to pay Gerald a visit. Accompanying her on the trip is her level-headed aunt Edith (Katherine Emery, best known for her starring role in the classic chiller ISLE OF THE DEAD). When Kitty and Edith arrive at the MacTeam estate they immediately suspect something strange is afoot. For starters Gerald seems to have aged twenty-years in a matter of weeks. Secondly, this once nice and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands they leave the castle and never come back. When Edith comes down with a mild cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is Gerald being so cold and cruel to the woman he was just about to marry? Why is Gerald so opposed to having company? Why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their bedrooms at night? Why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the estate, such as Gerald&#39;s bedroom and a large hedge maze out back? And what&#39;s making those strange dragging noises every night? These are just some of the questions THE MAZE poses. The movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue. You genuinely become interested in what&#39;s going on and patiently await the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place. And then IT happens... I definitely don&#39;t want to ruin the finale of this film because you&#39;re better off not knowing, but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jaw-droppingly strange turns I&#39;ve seen in any movie. It&#39;s wonderfully ludicrous in a way, but it also takes a pretty solid little b/w mystery and sends it straight into Z-Grade schlock territory. And yet, this ending seems so out of place, you&#39;re not likely to forget it once you see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the ending (or maybe even partially because of the ending), I really enjoyed this odd bird. It&#39;s extremely talky and slow moving for the duration of the run time, but it managed to keep my interest throughout. Director William Cameron Menzies (who made the much more famous INVADERS FROM MARS the same year) is best known as a two-time Oscar-winning art director and his set designs here are also really interesting. There&#39;s almost a silent movie feel at times, with model work for some of the exteriors, some painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As with any good castle set there are also secret passageways and long staircases. This one also throws in a few rubber-bats-on-strings for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few of the actors are a little stiff and awkward, but I liked most of the cast. Hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented. Emery, who also gets to play narrator in framing shots at the beginning and end of the film, is decent enough as the overly mannered and cautious aunt. My favorite however was Michael Pate as the silver-haired sinister servant who does this hilariously upright zombie walk every time he ascends the stairs. Also on board in smaller roles are Hillary Brooke (who played the title role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery THE WOMAN IN GREEN) and Lilian Bond (Whale&#39;s THE OLD DARK HOUSE). Of course Carlson also starred in IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and some other horror flicks, so you&#39;ve got yourself a pretty decent cast for genre fans right there. I say check it out!&#34;
b&#34;The reason I think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion. From the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are. You understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others. You can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once. You see humanity at its best AND at it&#39;s worst. You can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and downfalls in them that you see in yourself. To a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters. I will say that I have have never EVER cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something. I implore you to watch this movie and take it&#39;s meaning to heart. That there is only one true thing and that is... love.&#34;
b&#34;i totally disagree with the person who first commented about this movie. to me, this storyline is about a man with growth hormonal disorder trying his best to look for the love he is yearning for. Trying his very best to fit into the society who doesn&#39;t seemed to accept him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He then met someone who treats him with best friend&#39;s love and was shown the way to receiving the love he always wanted to have. the man who created all that happiness in returned received something important from the giant, which is family and spouse love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the comedy, it&#39;s just part of making the audience feel some laughter bugs at certain part of the shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i must admit, it made me tear a little.&#34;
b&#39;I saw &#34;The Reader&#34; at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat. Haven\&#39;t we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories squeezed to fit the format, or stage stories that weren\&#39;t properly adapted to screen? I applaud &#34;The Reader&#34; for really doing it right, and I encourage anyone who is interested in film and in storytelling to look at it seriously. Worth every moment!&#39;
b&#34;This story documenting the rise of China&#39;s first emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive movie production in Chinese history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s worth every penny. Visually dazzling cinematography, a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film (foreign or otherwise.) Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.&#34;
b&#39;I have a strong feeling that what you think of this film will strongly depend on your frame of reference. If you\&#39;ve never seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will probably confuse the heck out of you. If you have seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will still probably confuse the heck out of you....but you won\&#39;t really care! That\&#39;s because I found that the first time I saw one of his animated films, I tried too hard to figure out what was happening and why--and it impacted my enjoyment of the film. Now that I have seen just about every Miyazaki film, I see the bizarreness and just take it all in--enjoying the beauty of it all. In many ways, these films (at least to Western audiences) is like drugs--lots of strange and beautiful images that don\&#39;t always initially make sense but sure feel great to see!! Of all the Miyazaki films, this might have the most unusual and incomprehensible story line--even more so than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But, like these and many other Studio Gibli films, if you just sit back and watch you are rewarded with a fabulous tale. But, because it is so hard to describe (and others have already done so), I won\&#39;t even go there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the artwork, it\&#39;s very typical of one of these Japanese films, though there was one noticeable change. There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds. This was NOT a bad thing at all--the lovely pastel-like look was very pleasing and unique. In some ways it looked like a tiny bit of Bill Plympton\&#39;s art style was infused into a typical Miyazaki film. With a high frame-rate, exceptional character animation (which imbued them with tons of personality) and a great &#34;wow-factor&#34;, this is an exceptional film for all ages. Though clearly designed more for younger audiences (the TOTORO fans especially), it is a bit scary here and there (during the storm segments) but there is plenty of great stuff for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically so), I loved the cute stuff and applaud the other-worldliness of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great film--among Miyazaki\&#39;s best. I don\&#39;t give it a 10 because I am hesitant to ever do that--plus I did like a few of the studio\&#39;s other films a bit more (particularly TOTORO). But that DOESN\&#39;T mean you shouldn\&#39;t rush out now and see it--do it and do yourself a favor.&#39;
b&#34;I have really nothing to add to all the other comments, save this: To me the film looked like a silent film slowly being adapted to sound. The text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression I suppose. Along the way the actors were allowed to leave the stilted, theatre-like acting; Marguerite Churchill very much looks like a typical early silent movie heroine at the beginning of the film, but at the end is allowed finer expressions. Gus, the Swede?, reminded me of the comic characters of Shakespeare plays, and Windy sounded to me like an early Donald Duck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly amazed me that it was all filmed outdoors, on location, and even though the dust of all the wagons, horses and cattle obscured the view it must actually have been like that for the real settlers! It also was clear to me that many of those Indians must have been real, and I didn&#39;t detect any overt racism towards them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a real Wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy by John Ford, and thought that Stage Coach was Wayne&#39;s first as a leading star, this film was a revelation. The plot is very simple, again reminding me of a silent film, but the grit is very real indeed! An amazing film to have been made with that technique and under those conditions in 1930.&#34;
b&#34;Victor Sjostrom, who is the grandfather of Swedish cinema, directed this stark, existentialist film about atonement, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption, and the bleakest moments of the human condition. He stars as David Holm, a no good-nick who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, only to later have to bargain for his soul with the driver of the phantom carriage: death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many silent films during the period, the film is nearly absent scenes with over-acting. The pacing does becomes tedious with its overly familiar Dickensian narrative. However, examining the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time, it&#39;s a very daring and unique film. Audiences of the time were not exposed to such subject matter, and the cinematography is tremendous, symbolic, and accompanied by double exposure effects and multi-layered flashbacks. It&#39;s a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching the film, it&#39;s easy to see the later influences this film had on Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of the great Bergman themes are here on full display. Sjostrom, of course, later starred in Bergman&#39;s masterpiece on alienation and loneliness: Wild Strawberries. This would be Sjostrom&#39;s final performance as an actor. Sjostrom based the script on a novel by Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.&#34;
b&#39;All you need is great house, a babysitter and a phone. Simon West directs this thrilling and chilling remake of the 1979 original. This version is more of a thriller than a horror flick. Emotionally tense with an escalating fear factor. Jill Johnson(Camilla Belle)needs to work off an excessive cell phone bill; she takes on the task of babysitting the two children of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis(Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a beautiful 1970ish wood and glass masterpiece. Secluded and peaceful. The kids are already in bed, the wind builds and is joined by down-pouring rain. The phone begins ringing, ringing, ringing. The babysitter is soon in a frantic mode of survival in fear of the creepy stranger on the other end of the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belle is great as the innocent, smart and strong teen babysitter. The voice of the stranger on the phone is that of Lance Henriksen, while the physical stranger is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also featured are: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Kudos to James Dooley for the atmospheric original music.&#39;
b&#34;this is another good western,which i enjoyed.it&#39;s not an epic or anything,but it is good for what it is.it&#39; about 3 fur trappers,led by a men named Jed,who is crude and uncivilized.Jed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and Indian band,who resent the Americans on their land,and want to take it back.that&#39;s the gist of the story.what follows is action,excitement,even a bit of humour,and forbidden romance.one of Jed&#39;s friends,Gus,reminded me a lot of the character Quint(played by Robert Shaw)in the movie Jaws.they both have that crusty,gruff demeanor.anyway,if you&#39;re a western fan,you should find lots to like about this particular entry.i think it deserves a 7/10&#34;
b&#34;Dashing Errol Flynn brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of George Armstrong Custer. The dashing, jovial Flynn essays Custer from his days at West Point as a reckless, headstrong cadet, through the Civil War years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history, and finally as the nonpareil Indian fighter whose blunder at the Little Big Horn is excused as a sacrifice by Custer of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the Plains Indians. Olivia de Havilland, Flynn&#39;s co-star in several other films, scores as the devoted, adoring Libby Bacon, and Anthony Quinn looks the part as the fierce Sioux chief Crazy Horse. The film&#39;s battle scenes are excellent. The Civil War battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which Custer, seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers, hammers the Confederate army into submission. Custer&#39;s last fight against the Indians is a grand spectacle, a savage clash between red men and white, with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men. Great direction, cinematography, casting and wonderful music by Max Steiner make this film a Hollywood classic.&#34;
b&#39;Fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose latest game - &#34;eXistenZ&#34; not only draws the attention of people who volunteer to try the game, but one who nearly kills her (and her game, too). Since she forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing trainee (&#34;P.R. nerd&#34;) to be her bodyguard even though he only has a gun that\&#39;s made out of flesh and bone and the bullets are teeth. Director David Cronenberg has, well, used some bits from his earlier films (&#34;Videodrome&#34;, &#34;Scanners&#34;, &#34;The Fly&#34;, etc.) and placed it into certain parts of the story with some good timing. Law and Leigh are fine here and so are some of the supporting cast (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston, and so on) that has an international twist to it. Dafoe is anything but devilish as Gas, a deceiving garage mechanic. One of the movie\&#39;s best scenes is witnessing Ted eat (fish and frogs) and construct a gun and admit to Allegra - &#34; I can\&#39;t help myself.&#34; &#34;eXistenZ&#34; manages to show that he (Cronenberg) is up to his old tricks and it still works like a charm.&#39;
b&#39;As part of an initiation prank Julie (Meg Tilly of Psycho 2) has to spend the night in a mausoleum, but Karl Rhamarevich, a master of telekinesis has recently died and been put in there. When Julie\&#39;s fellow sorority sisters desecrate where he\&#39;s housed the real terror starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little flick had a good deal of atmosphere and I enjoyed the build up, plus the last twenty minutes are just plain great. Anyone who\&#39;s looking for a lost gem of an \&#39;80\&#39;s horror movie needn\&#39;t look any further. Highly under-appreciated. Plus Elizabeth Daily is adorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: B &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Media Blaster DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary with director Tom McLoughlin and co-writer Michael Hawes; and trailers for &#34;the Being&#34;, &#34;Frankestien\&#39;s Bloody Terror&#34;, &#34;Just Before Dawn&#34;, &amp; &#34;Devil Dog&#34; Disc 2) Alternate director\&#39;s cut (that\&#39;s almost unwatchable due to a bad print) &amp; Behind-the-scenes featurette&#39;
b&#34;Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville&#39;s Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing &#39;twists in the tale&#39;...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you &#39;jump&#39;. A good tight production at around only 80 minutes, probably produced on a very limited budget, but a success, which should see Fellowes directing again for the big screen. Some publicity for the film seemed to suggest it was set in the 50s (as per Nigel Balchin&#39;s novel)but obviously this is not the case. Recommended viewing.&#34;
b&#34;Jack Black and Kyle Gass team together to promote their band Tenacious D in this Rock Classic called Tenacious D In The Pick Of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invent their own Rock Opera..it was like an Opera of Rock &#39;N&#39; Roll. Some of the most twisted events took place in that movie....the big foot part....the mushroom part....and in the end when they did the rock off against the Devil. A classic formed in Tenacious D....one of the best films I have seen in a long time. The last couple things I saw in the theater were stupid..but this movie rocks. This really made me laugh hard. The whole basis is Jack Black runs of to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and man who has always been bald. They work together to find this magic pick that can make the most terrible musician play greatly. They finally make it to the Rock &#39;N&#39; Roll Museum and steal the pick. On the way they meet The Stranger Played By Tim Robbins. They make it to the club to win their prize money when the owner grabs the pick and all along he was the devil and he battles the D in a Rock Off. The D doesn&#39;t win but the Devil&#39;s horn falls off sending him back to hell. Therefore LONG LIVE THE D!!!!!!!!!!&#34;
b&#39;I don\&#39;t think the world was ready for this film. I know I wasn\&#39;t. I\&#39;d been expected a standard low-budget schlock exploitation potboiler. Instead, I got the most intelligent reworking of Shakespeare since Peter Greenaway\&#39;s &#34;Prospero\&#39;s Books&#34;. This should become the definitive film version of Romeo And Juliet. It won\&#39;t of course. But that\&#39;s the world\&#39;s loss.&#39;
b&#34;Wonderfully funny, awe-inspiring feature on the pioneers of turntablism. DJ Shadow and Q-Bert are amazing in this terrific documentary. Check out just about every major DJ crediting their getting in to scratch thanks to Herbie Hancock&#39;s post-bop classic &#39;Rockit&#39;, and archival footage of some of the most complex and mind-blowing turntable routines of all time.&#34;
b&#34;This film tops the previous incarnation by a mile, taking everything to the next level. As always the JackAss guys are purely unbelievable, and I personally laughed harder in that theatre than I have in a long time. Like the first JackAss, this isn&#39;t so much a movie as an eighty minute long string of stunts and pranks. It is pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level. Essentially these guys are clowns, debasing themselves for the amusement of others. And its great. The shenanigans are so low, outrageous, and often disgusting that they transcend into a higher form of entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#39;t rate this along other movies, its in a class of its own. And it shines. Go and enjoy it for the pure spectacle that it is.&#34;
b&#34;I watched Sleeper Cell with a bit of trepidation worrying over whether the terrorists would be glorified. This mesmerizing series not only handled the subject matter responsibly, it created depth and substance to almost every character. Oded Fehr just gobbles up the screen in every scene he&#39;s in\xc2\x97and even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy held his own well, though in some scenes I wondered why he wasn&#39;t shot on the spot because of the scowl he wore on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of the series are the two leads, Fehr and Ealy, the well written characters--all of which were believable and tragic, and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story. Having been married to a Muslim myself, the atmosphere created was quite realistic. The cons, for me personally, were that the female T&amp;A was overkill\xc2\x97most seemed gratuitous, as well as some of the sex scenes. Despite that, it is a raw gripping series that will make you think. Somebody give Fehr more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it. He&#39;s got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating off him.&#34;
b&#39;This is a cute little movie that provides pretty much what it promises - some good entertainment. After all, when a movie proclaims it features top SASS shooters, you have to figure that it is not a likely candidate for the &#34;Best Picture&#34; Oscar. Those guys are shooters, not actors. Your next clue is that the movie doesn\&#39;t star Nicholas Cage or Jennifer Aniston, i.e. you shouldn\&#39;t expect to see the current hottest names. It was meant to be just plain old entertainment and in that regard it is every bit as good as a lot of the old &#34;oaters&#34; I have seen through the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO what do you get with &#34;Hell To Pay&#34;? You get 100 minutes of good old entertainment. You get a chance to see some stars from past years, who act pretty much like what they did in their prime but a little older. You get to see some good SASS shooters in major roles and a few SASS hams in the background. It was a lot of fun for me seeing people that I have shot with, visited in their homes and who are my good friends get to do something that a lot of people only ever dream about - they\&#39;re in a real, live honest to gosh movie. They\&#39;re doing something a lot of wannabe actors and wannabe shooters will never get the chance to do and I think that alone makes it worth the watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, not everyone is a SASS member and so I saw lots of fun and humor that others may miss, but it is still good, old-fashioned entertainment, and frankly, there are a LOT of movies in the theatre right now that I wouldn\&#39;t give a nickel to see, so save the money to go see &#34;Brokeback Mountain&#34; get &#34;Hell to Pay&#34; and watch some real cowboys have some fun.&#39;
b&#39;An off beat but very delightful performance by John Travolta sets off this very funny comedy. His interpretation of the archangel is as a scuffy, womanizing, overweight, ladies man. And, he certainly has a mesmerizing effect on the women he encounters on his trip to Chicago. John Hurt is very low keyed in his role as chief reporter for Chicago Tabloid owner, Bob Hoskins. Angie MacDowell plays role much as she did her role in &#34;Four Weddings and a Funeral.&#34; Maureen Stapleton is neat in a cameo. Her comment, &#34;Michael doesn\&#39;t suffer fools,&#34; is just one of many memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only one of the lead performers who fails to connect, a little to off the wall. Mainly you\&#39;re there to see Michael take on a bull, mesmerize the waitresses and lady dancers at a western style restaurant, and fully demonstrate that he is complete free soul. It is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing.&#39;
b&#39;This movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors. I only knew about it because I am a long time Jean-Claude Van Damme fan and I always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command), they are. This movie has an easy enough plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good, humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the final one of them together. The editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but Isaac Florentine can definitely film a good fight scene. I too am happy that Van Damme has been acting better lately (In Hell, Wake of Death, Until Death) but with the good acting came less martial arts. In The Shepherd, Van Damme proves that he still has it.&#39;
b&#34;Sj\xc3\xb6str\xc3\xb6ms masterpiece and a movie that captures the swedish soul . It also served as a great inspiration for Bergman; the similarites between K\xc3\xb6rkarlen and Smultronst\xc3\xa4llet (with Sj\xc3\xb6str\xc3\xb6m in the leading role as Isak Borg) from 1957 is not a coincidence. Don&#39;t miss it for the world!&#34;
b&#39;I was a Marine at Camp Pendleton when the D.I. came out (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I still remember standing in line with a bunch of other Marines to see the movie at the &#34;Star&#34; theater in Oceanside, California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was. The idea of using real Marines in the movie was a great idea (I believe they were all real Drill Instructors too). As good an actor as Jack Webb was, he just couldn\&#39;t &#34;call cadence&#34; like a real Marine Drill Instructor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of us got a laugh when the &#34;problem&#34; recruit\&#39;s mother came to boot camp to talk to the Captain. Never in a million years would this have happened, but that\&#39;s Hollywood, and we didn\&#39;t let that episode keep us from enjoying the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through boot camp at MCRD in San Diego during the summer of 1956, and at that time there was virtually no limits as to what the D.I.\&#39;s could do to you. The &#34;Ribbon Creek&#34; event at Parris Island had not yet affected boot camp, at least not at MCRD - San Diego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with what a lot of the other reviewers have commented on concerning Sgt. Moore\&#39;s &#34;stiffness&#34; around his girl friend. I believe this was just Webb\&#39;s acting style, and although they could have deleted this part of the movie, it didn\&#39;t really hurt the production that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor note, the character (uncredited) of &#34;Pvt. Rodriguez&#34; was played by one of my Drill Instructors, Sgt. Peter J. O\&#39;Neill. Sgt. O\&#39;Neill used to tell us that some day he wanted to be an actor. We secretly laughed at this, but he surprised us all. He was a great Drill Instructor, and I thought he did well in his bit part. Also, he really did enjoy throwing knives. He often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp. I have often wondered if he is still alive.&#39;
b&#34;But quite dated today. Otto Preminger made this movie without the certificate of approval that was needed then. It was enormously courageous and risky as he could have lost his investment and future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately hollywoodized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank Sinatra (and I&#39;ve never been a fan) playing Frankie Machine, is astonishing in his performance. One forgets it is Frank up there, the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim Novak, eternally gorgeous and talented, does not disappoint in the role of the devoted outsider, always there for Frankie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supporting roles, particularly a young, handsome and talented Darrin Mc Gavin, are faultless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleanor Parker, playing Frankie&#39;s wife, is hopelessly inept. She swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top. A forgettable performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stagey, cheap settings are appalling, as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole tacky painted cardboards over the horizon. Almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music was irritating, poundingly so at times. As if each nuance of the script (example: when Louie is getting Frankie his fix out of a drawer) had to be underscored at a high decibel level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 out of 10. Sinatra truly deserved his Oscar nomination. Worth seeing.&#34;
b&#39;Brought Philip Larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time, and not just the ones that are measured by popularity. It shows a stark portrayal of Larkins life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his era - which is exactly how he would have wanted it, such was his disdain for cankers and medallions. It dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of Philips observations of our relationship with our own mortality, and lays it our in a way that seems to have missed even the great philosophers. for anyone interested in profound observations of our relationship with life, love and death this is a must.&#39;
b&#34;Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless soulless CGI movies being made. The pastel and color pencil backgrounds were a surprise after Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi(Spirited Away) and Hauru no Ugoku Shiro(Howl&#39;s Moving Castle) being so similar stylistically. The style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well. The time and effort put in to animate this is greatly appreciated as it gives the characters so much more life, the detail and care it takes makes the movie turn out so much better. There are several great scenes throughout the movie that have lots of movement and action. The greatest to me being a scene were Ponyo&#39;s sisters transform into massive wave like fish while she runs on top of them. The story is simple but fairly well written and played out. The plot stayed focused around character relationships and while it wasn&#39;t played out as well as in Tonari no Totoro(My Neighbor Totoro) it is still great. I felt that each character had the an appropriate amount of screen time unlike Spirited Away which was so jammed with distinctive characters that it could have been stretched out into an entire series.(The Radish Spirit. There was a another whole movie right there!) My only real problem with the movie was the end. The way its worded in the English version at least makes it seem like there&#39;s going to be some great test given to S\xc5\x8dsuke which turns out to be just him promising Ponyos mother that he will love Ponyo. Though putting more thought into this leads me to think that translation may not be that accurate to the actual meaning in that the test is the promise and that deep down he really means it. The movie did seem to end abruptly though. Other than that the movie was great and I highly recommend it.&#34;
b&#34;I would rate this film high on my list of Ingrid Bergman films. Ingrid&#39;s beauty aside, her talent is evident in scene after scene. She was sad, mean, witty,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;snobbish, flirtatious, delightfully funny, loving, tender, sorrowful, distressed, happy, etc. You name it, she was all those things and more. -And so&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;convincing. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio) who comes back to New&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orleans and falls for a Texas gambler, Gary Cooper (Clint). I especially loved the scene where they are sitting at the dining table saying nothing, just staring at each other. She, in an elegant white gown and he in a handsome white cowboy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;outfit, sitting there looking at her adoringly. What chemistry! What love!&#34;
b&#39;This film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Anywhere But Here&#34; is an engaging film from beginning to the end. Both Ann and Adele are described well right at the start, so we get to know how different their personalities are. Clashes inevitably ensue, and they are engagingly presented. I find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances. it is as if I am living their lives, feeling what they are feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Sarandon gives another excellent performance in &#34;Anywhere But Here&#34;. She is charismatic, happy go lucky, hedonistic, warm and loving all at once. I have always liked Susan Sarandon, and I think she is grossly underrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Anywhere But Here&#34; is a captivating emotional journey.&#39;
b&#34;A man is wrongfully accused of killing his friend in an aircraft plant fire, and must travel cross-country to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation at hand. A plot line that was later used to fuel Hitchcock&#39;s classic North by Northwest, Saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as some masterful suspense sequences from the Master himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any Hitchcock fan, the plot is a bit too familiar, but he was always able to infuse the story with its own memorable supporting characters and charades. Here, the likable and charming Robert Cummings is the lead and soon finds himself visiting many strange and quirky characters, not withstanding a troupe of circus performers, a rich businessman with hidden motives, and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of sheer originality and quality, this does lack in some areas, particularly the motive of the antagonists. However, there is some nice chemistry between Cummings and his lead lady, the much under-appreciated Priscilla Lane as well as a truly moving performance as the blind man by Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly mirrors what Hitchcock would use later in North by Northwest, only this time the climax is atop a statue in New York. Certainly not his best, but the Master of Suspense gives us some great moments to wait for.&#34;
b&#34;As a huge fan of horror, I had given up on the vampire sub-genre due to the fact that in most vampire flicks the vampire has become feminine and non-threatening, benign and basically weak. This was the attitude I brought to a viewing of Soul&#39;s Midnight and I am happy to say that the vampires in this film at least have the hunger to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that interested me is that the central location is the Borgo Hotel. That is cool because (and I went back to my high school copy to look this up) in Dracula, the Borgo Pass is where Jonathan Harker must pass to get to Dracula&#39;s castle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my hats off to whoever made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a darn CGI! That&#39;s the one thing great about many low-budget movies, they cannot afford the garbage computer effects that plague many Hollywood monstrosities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...this is better than Underworld for sure, especially if you are a vampire purest. Cheers, JA&#34;
b&#39;Bridget Fonda has disappointed me several times over the years, but she had my attention in BREAK UP. It\&#39;s true the story is missing critical details in several places, but I just kept scrutinizing Fonda for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she didn\&#39;t let me down. The look in her eyes in the last scene, as she musters up courage to, literally, put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face acting ever. I believed her completely, possibly because I\&#39;ve known and admired several &#34;tough broads&#34; who survived similar abusive situations. And they did this without becoming man-haters, but that\&#39;s my own hopeful projection of Fonda\&#39;s character at the BREAK UP.&#39;
b&#34;Harrowing series about life in Oz--an experimental prison where they try to rehabilitate prisoners. There&#39;s gay sex, rape, torture, mutilation, killings, humiliation, tons of male nudity...all in your face and going full force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is easily one of the best written dramas ever put on TV and almost all the actors are just great. Since this was on cable there were no restrictions on what they could say or show. There&#39;s plenty of racist comments flying in here but it&#39;s for all races. In fact the white characters come off pretty badly (especially the Aryans) and the black characters come off better (the peace-loving Muslims). The Hispanics don&#39;t have a strong role and there are NO Asian prisoners at all. All the prisoners seem to be back-stabbers and willing to kill anyone at a moments notice---but you still find yourself sympathizing with some of them. Even the guards, counselors and doctors at the prison have serious issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend this BUT rent it--don&#39;t buy it. I have the whole collection and, to be totally honest, I don&#39;t think I ever want to see it again. It&#39;s incredible TV but so grim, dark and depressing. Guess I gotta sell it all online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 10.&#34;
b&#34;I don&#39;t skateboard because I think it&#39;s gay but this game is really great it&#39;s smooth, fast, easy to play, and just fun even if you don&#39;t do so well. It can be just really fun to make the skaters just crash and burn, easily one of the best video games ever!&#34;
b&#39;There must have been some interesting conversations on the set of Eagle\&#39;s Wing, with Martin Sheen straight off Apocalypse Now co-starred with the actor he replaced on Coppola\&#39;s film, Harvey Keitel. A real unloved child of a movie, dating back to the last major batch of Westerns in 1979-80, it was much reviled at the time for being made by a British studio and director (conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic American westerns were directed by European \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s), which seems a bit of an over-reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is simplicity itself, as Martin Sheen\&#39;s inexperienced trapper finds himself fighting with Sam Waterston\&#39;s nonosyllabic Kiowa warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse, the Eagle\&#39;s Wing, across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time &#34;before the legends began.&#34; Aside from Caroline Langrishe\&#39;s captive Irish governess, the supporting cast have little to do (Stephane Audran never even gets to open her mouth) and it is a little slow, but Anthony Harvey\&#39;s film does boast terrific Scope photography from Billy Williams and a good score from Marc Wilkinson.&#39;
b&#39;I read a viciously hidden remarks on a previous comments stating that this film showed a bunch of gay guys romping around their gayness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This couldn\&#39;t be more misleading. &#34;Eighteen&#34; is not a gay film. It has only three gay characters in it and one of them is the victim of prejudice of people like the one who wrote the comments, despite his confession of fairness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pip\&#39;s grandfather was not gay. The tender scene of the soldier and his sergeant is male bonding at the crucial moment of death. But some people gets appalled by a kiss and welcome scene of guts flying out of a man killed by a bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The focus of the film is the straight relationship of Pip and that sweet girl and their facing their social obligation and parenthood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ralph Rewes www.r1313.info&#39;
b&#39;*Warning! Some spoilers!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt, a rich writer, is in fact still just a boy in his behaviour. He doesn\&#39;t care about anyone\&#39;s but his own needs and couldn\&#39;t care less about the consequences of any of his actions. Just as he gets to know Nimi and her bonds with her familiy and her communitiy he starts to feel that something is missing in his live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He starts to realize that he is in fact lonely and stuck in impersonal structures that are just convenient but lack heart and commitment. Nevertheless he shies away from any responsibilties and is reluctant to change his live. But will he be able to settle again in his old life and ignore the bonds he\&#39;s already - unconsciously - formed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nimi\&#39;s situation is the absolute opposite. She is pressed into the regulations of her Nigerian community, its prejudices and its medieval values. Being a single mother her position is difficult and it gets even worse when she falls in love with Matt, a white devil (as the Referend would say), a man who cannot commit. The women of the community plan to marry her to the Referend to end her single status and give Sammy &#34;a name&#34;. But that would mean for Nimi to give up all independence and self-determination. But is there an alternative for her if she wants Sammy to be accepted and herself to become a respected member of the community?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with VERY sexy scenes of Matt and Nimi) and an endearing child who is eagerly matchmaking, a beautiful scenery in lively colours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colin Firth (*swoon*) and Nia Long show a great chemistry. It\&#39;s just fantastic to watch them. And Fissy Roberts as Sammy is just to die for. You simply want to adopt him. I just love the way Sammy and Matthew talk to each other. They are both on the same level in many ways. Especially when Sammy asks Matt about Sex. This scene is absolutely adorable!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost nothing to complain about.... wait! That\&#39;s not true. One thing is not good: That the movie is not long enough! (Well, and maybe that the Referend is too bad and too silly to be convincing....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 of 10, by all means!&#39;
b&#39;If you want a film with the full range of emotion, look NO further; dramatic and funny, and scenes of wrenching emotion; I can safely guarantee VERY few will be able to view this warm and VERY human film without shedding a tear now and then. The acting by the two leads is hard to believe; you would swear the two young men really DO suffer from Muscular Dystrophy (Rory) and Cerebral Palsy (Michael); quite simply, two of the FINEST performances I have EVER seen; these are two very believable characters as well, and you never have the feeling things have just been &#34;tossed in&#34; for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy. In the DVD release as &#34;extras&#34; they have &#34;deleted scenes&#34; (including an alternate ending) and an &#34;extended party sequence&#34;; why these clips were not included in the final film is hard to understand, as they tie in with the rest of the film perfectly and are in NO way superfluous. But without reservation I can heartily recommend this film to anyone; one of the very best I have ever seen.&#39;
b&#34;Sadness and nostalgia permeate Late Chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by Japanese auteur Mikio Naruse, now undergoing a retrospective of his long unavailable films thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation. Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi, Late Chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired geishas, now middle-aged, whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret. Performance are uniformly outstanding, particularly that of Haruko Sugimura, who starred in films by Ozu&#39;s Late Spring, Floating Weeds, and Tokyo Story among others. Sugimura portrays Kin, a former Geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money, particularly real estate speculation and loaning money to her friends, Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa), and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki), all former geishas. Kin&#39;s friends live in meager circumstances and complain about how Kin has become greedy and Tomi spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet. Both Tomi and Tamae are in the process of losing their children. Tamae&#39;s son is leaving to work in the coalmines in Hokkaido, and Tomi&#39;s daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man. Both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two male friends visit Kin, Seki a former lover with whom she once contemplated double suicide, and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years. Her mood is upbeat but soon turns to resentment when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. Naruse cuts between two extended sequences seamlessly as Kin confronts Tabe and Tomi and Tamae console each other over the loss of their children The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who, though their future does not seem bright, refuse to see themselves merely as victims. Late Chrysanthemums has the simplicity, humor, and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of Ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Everything is Illuminated&#34; is like viewing a fine piece of museum quality artwork. It absolutely inundates the emotions through a very broad spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer is played with candor by Elijah Wood. He is in search of his paternal heritage in the Ukraine. His travels bring him in contact with Alex, played very well and with extreme humor by Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional tie to this film and he is aptly portrayed by Boris Leskin. If one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema, then one has only to turn to Mikke, a real dog who is called Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. by Alex and his grandfather. They also call him the &#34;seeing eye bitch&#34;. The cinematography is spectacular. The colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. It is a film worth the time and emotional investment.&#39;
b&#34;The best Batman movie of the 90&#39;s no doubt about it. This movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the villains are somewhat cheesy, they fit perfect for the movie&#39;s tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t get fooled by the cheesy outfits, this is a movie in the pure style of Burton. That can&#39;t be described; Burton is a sui generis director that took the Batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about it&#39;s comic style past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all, if it deals with super heroes.&#34;
b&#39;Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film. The writing, acting, directing could not have been better. This was a story that begged to be told, and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so. Stories like this one are not pleasant ones, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world. It is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed. A film that can do that is a rare a special thing. Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer, and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for telling this story!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruby&#39;
b&#39;A blaxploitation classic, this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the &#34;toasts&#34; that Rudy Ray Moore performs. Toasts are long rhyming stories that are funny and deliver a point, and you can see how they would naturally evolve into rap. For more on toasts, Rudy Ray Moore, and why this movie is important, go to Dolemite.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leaves us just to talk about the movie itself. This movie packs in a great deal of &#34;laugh-at-the-funny-outfits-and-hairstyles&#34; bang for the buck, as nearly every shot has some sort of outrageous element or dialogue. It starts as Dolemite is being released from prison in order to find out who framed him and bring him to justice. I was unaware that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence, but that\&#39;s me, I\&#39;m a neophyte in the prison scene. He is helped in this by Queen Bee, who is Dolemite\&#39;s lead prostitute and has been running his brothel while he\&#39;s been gone. She has also put all of his prostitutes through karate school, so now he has an army of female karate fighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched this movie in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case it provided an interesting contrast. The first part I watched on my lunch break while exercising, and wasn\&#39;t enjoying it much at all. It struck me as particularly poorly made blaxploitation, with a ludicrous story, shoddy craftsmanship\xc2\x97well, I guess that makes it sound like it had SOME craftsmanship\xc2\x97and tons of outrageous locales, outfits and dialogue. But I wasn\&#39;t enjoying that\xc2\x97in fact, it kind of made me feel dirty. Let\&#39;s face it, a white guy watching something like this to laugh at the outfits and the things the characters say is essentially getting an enjoyment out of it that is racist: how ridiculously those black people dress, what silly things they say. I wasn\&#39;t really enjoying it, wasn\&#39;t laughing, and wasn\&#39;t looking forward to watching the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that night, when I was in a &#34;much more relaxed state,&#34; I watched the rest\xc2\x97and legitimately loved it. Like Disco Godfather, which I had watched a few days previously, this has a warmth and sweetness at its core that makes it likable even when it\&#39;s silly or violent. The character of Dolemite has an element of self-parody about him that makes the whole thing fun, and the appearance of several actors who were also in Disco Godfather implies that we\&#39;re watching the group effort of a bunch of friends who just want to make something fun together. Even the poor dubbing, karate fights, and everything else just makes it that much more charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I find interesting about the Dolemite films is that they have some moral ambiguity I don\&#39;t see in other blaxploitation films, and certainly in very few mainstream films. In this one, there is an African-American woman who gives a speech about the (white) Mayor, saying &#34;he has done more for the black community than anyone.&#34; We later find out that the Mayor is, surprise, corrupt, but I like that the movie would present this woman as essentially misguided and not try to &#34;redeem&#34; her in some other way. There\&#39;s also the figure of the Hamburger Pimp, who is presented as a useless junkie, and no one makes an effort to find some redeeming, socially positive angle to what he is, he just is. In Disco Godfather the religious character Lady Reed plays is presented as just nuts for wanting to pray for her child, hopelessly lost to angel dust. I like that the films would present such harshly critical portrayals of people in their own community without sugar-coating or trying to redeem them to make them more palatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of hootworthy elements, such as when Dolemite says &#34;Move over and let me pass, or I\&#39;m gonna be pulling these Hush Puppies out your muthatf** a**.&#34; There is Queen Bee reaching over and answering the phone: &#34;Dolemite\&#39;s Total Experience.&#34; And you will not be able to miss (though you may wish to cover your eyes) the extended nude scene by the REPULSIVE Mayor. I am all for mustachioed pervy older men, but even I have limits\xc2\x97-and my limits are usually a few miles past most people\&#39;s, so be warned. The DVD I had is clearly edited, which is noticeable in certain of the dialogue scenes, and at the end, when Dolemite\&#39;s killing of a major character with his bare hands obviously excludes the main event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do get the DVD, however, be sure to watch all three trailers for the Dolemite films, as they are a hoot. I wasn\&#39;t going to watch The Human Tornado, but after seeing that trailer, you\&#39;d better BELIEVE that I am. Also, there is a scene in the Dolemite trailer that I don\&#39;t remember from the movie when Dolemite swings at a Mexican-looking thug, obviously misses, and the guy flips himself into a nearby car trunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching the first half, I was going to say to skip this and watch Disco Godfather, as the film-making and story has marginally improved, but after really enjoying the second half, I would advise watching this one over Disco Godfather, as this one is even more exuberantly fun, outrageous, and good-natured\xc2\x97and has those toasts which, even if one doesn\&#39;t understand the roots and nuances of the form, are still something to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- Check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com&#39;
b&#34;The fact that after 50 years, it is still a highly watchable movie, says a lot about it. It is more intelligent and interesting than almost all recent movies of the same genre you can find, and has a certain endearing feeling of innocence to it. I am not a big fan of this type of movies, but I could watch the whole thing without being bored, which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share your taste in films. I liked the black and white palette, the excellent casting, the clever heist scene that keeps you guessing about what trick they will pull next, and the ending like everyone else. Watching the heist sequence makes one realize the power of silence, which is unfortunately so underused in today&#39;s cinema.&#34;
b&#34;I have seen this movie twice and it&#39;s theme is an invigorating one. I have been into computers for many years now and this movie inspired me in a technologically sense as does a fresh love which stoked the furnace of my poetic passion in the heat of infatuation. Very original idea,great allurement in the way it holds you as it tells it&#39;s story to minds that need a release from the every day realities of this life.&#34;
b&#34;I found the movie Judas Kiss excellent. Carla Gugino&#39;s performance was extraordinaire, probably her best in her career. Her facial expressions in many scenes, were unbelievably true to character, and they were exploited to its best by Director Gutierrez. All actors and actresses were very good in their performances. Emma Thompsom was, as usual, marvelous. Her acting capabilities are way above what would be required for this character, so she actually enhances it in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story, although sometimes over-intricate, is kept entertaining and pointed towards the end. Very, very good. A movie not to be missed. A story well weaved and brilliantly directed. Quality of film, excellent.&#34;
b&#34;This is a film about a six year old child from a village in Maharashtra (a state in India) and his grandfather who come to Pune (a city in Maharashtra) to treat the child&#39;s eyes. here the grandfather gets to know that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they have to be removed to save the child&#39;s life. the movie is all about the main characters&#39; and their feelings and actions until the operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is not a typical clich\xc3\xa9 Indian movie, so dun expect to see songs or romance or melodrama. this ia a supremely crafted sensitive movie which resorts to silent expressions rather than over the top dialogs to get the point thru. witness the scene where the grandfather is told about the need to remove the child&#39;s eyes. the acting is superb, dialogs heart breaking. your heart goes out for the grandfather who has the unenviable task of telling the child and his mother about the operation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the handling of the subject has been excellent. the film was made under great hardship by the director, Sandeep Sawant who had to knock many doors to gather the Rs. six million (approx. $130000) budget. even then the final product seems polished and has decent production values. also witness the subtle city village contrast shown by the director by incorporating some random shots of the boy&#39;s life in the village. Sawant definitely seems to prefer village life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THe acting by all is excellent. Amruta Subhash as the social worker is competent adding the required humane touch to her role. Sandeep Kulkarni as the docter is great, showing perfect mannerisms of a doctor. Ashwin Chitale as the child is a natural. he doesn&#39;t seem to be acting. everything about him is natural and does not seem forced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But towering above all is Arun Nalawade as the grandfather. he is astounding in his role. mere words cannot describe his work. it is a performance to cherish forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shwaas is a sincere effort to make good cinema. it should not be ignored just for the fact that it shows that if things are kept simple, the the results can be really surprising. 10/10.&#34;
b&#39;Stan as a bullfighter, and a good one, is quite a surprise. Usually overshadowed by Oliver Hardy, this silent short allows him to take the lead, and the limelight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can only draw the conclusion that his character &#34;Rhubarb Vaselino&#34; was a parody of the many Rudolph Valentino movies of this era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to laugh yourself silly at some of the dialog, and keep an eye on the special effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I viewed this on DVD in a Vol.1 &amp; 2 collection.&#39;
b&#34;Shirley Knight plays Sara Ravenna, a Long Island housewife who runs away from her marriage when she discovers she is pregnant. She plans to drive into America&#39;s heartland and start anew. Along the way she picks up a friendly hitchhiker (James Caan) who calls himself &#39;Killer.&#39; Soon she discovers that the good natured &#39;Killer&#39; is actually brain damaged, and by picking him up she has unknowingly taken on a huge responsibility. The two of them drive all the way to Nebraska, where Sara gets Killer a job helping out at a roadside reptile farm. It is here that Sara meets Gordon, a local cop, and soon things go horribly wrong for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a powerful drama about people disconnected from society, alienated by the choices they make or by the limits imposed on them by others. Even with such a low budget and a very freewheeling attitude, the film is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complex, diverging role and there are moments of some awe-inspiring acting by her. One of my favorites is when she is on the telephone calling her home to her worried husband the first time. It is such a tense scene on both ends, and in every small gesture and inflection of a word, so much about her is spoken with so little. Then comes in the character of &#39;Killer&#39; played by James Caan. This character is unlike any I&#39;ve ever seen him play, and he performs wonderfully. It&#39;s one of his best performances as he is very restrained and moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way Coppola develops the characters by using short, dream-like flashbacks is very clever, adding a fragmented kind of view onto it all. The quick flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained contrast well with the longer shots in some crucial scenes. Also, because this film was shot on location all over the Eastern U.S., it offers an interesting, authentic look at America in the late 1960&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#39;t seen many other films starring Ms. Knight, I&#39;m only familiar with her more recent work on television, usually playing a nagging mother in law or a dotty old woman. It was great seeing her so young, beautiful, and so wonderfully subtle in this movie. It&#39;s also kind of a shame that James Caan went on to be typecast as the &#39;tough guy&#39; for the rest of his career, because this film evidenced that he is capable of so much more than that.&#34;
b&#34;The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that&#39;s not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren&#39;t any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question. I know that the songs belong to Country Music and is sung by a country artist. I just need the title names along with the singer. I would recommend this movie or rather the songs to any country loving person.&#34;
b&#39;Looks as if the Robocop writer has been wholesale looting The Vindicator. This is a very solid horror/action movie about a man set up in an accident to be used in cruel experiment. Anyone who have seen Robocop knows the story. Watch out for Pam Grier as a bitchy and darn good looking assassin. This highly effective, violent and bloody horror movie may not be to everyones liking, but this Canadian outing is well worth seeking out for anyone who is fan of the genre. 8/10&#39;
b&#34;I found the movie very real just as much as Saving Private Ryan and gave an upfront account from the German perspective. The graphic action and individual characters gave this movie much to keep me interested through the whole movie. Stalingrad was very brutal battle and the scenes gave this movie that stark reality of this battle. I recommend this for anyone who is interested in military history. This was my second viewing of this movie in a few years and was captivated by it&#39;s realism again. The weapons, uniforms, and hearing it German while reading the subtitles gave it much credit for a good military movie. In fact, this being a German perspective of the battle, I was rooting for the Germans, even though they were the agressor and ultimate loser of the war.&#34;
b&#39;Beautiful, emotional, and subtle. I watch this movie at an art center with a smaller screen in a film room with 95% of senior citizens. I wish bigger cinema like Lowes around here would show it. Great cinematography by Wong and Christopher Doyle. Since I understand cantonese, it\&#39;s a lot easier for me to understand the movie. As simple as the story goes, many English speaking viewers didn\&#39;t get the whole story. Three old ladies next to me keep yapping and have no clues about the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler; They were surprise when I mention that Mr. Chow did sleep with Mrs Chen and they have a son. She went to Singapore trying to tell him but didn\&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mandarin translation of the movie title actually means flowery like moment or memory. The phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was inpermanance and short. The whole movie pretty much fit the title. Not to mention the flowery &#34;Cheung Sam&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite scene was definately the street corner in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun shining on the old and faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, truely a poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of intimacy of their relationship seeing them standing against the wall and talk quietly. I felt a terrible heartache when Mr Chow was rehearsing his departing moment, and Mrs Chen cried on his shoulder.... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I like this one, Chungking Express still top my favorite. However, I\&#39;ll give this one a 10 as well. As a point of reference, CTHD only got 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love art, you will love this movie. Don\&#39;t miss it.&#39;
b&#34;This lesser known film starring Roy Thinnes (From TV&#39;s Invaders) is actually what I consider a lost gem. It was made at a time where the story was more important that the special effects (though the effect are fairly good for its time). A scientist theorizes that there is another world in Earth&#39;s Orbit directly behind the sun. Since the sun always blocks it from us we can never see it from Earth. Roy Thinnes is selected to go on a mission to get to this world. I don&#39;t want to tell the rest of the plot because it will give the rest of the movie away. Let&#39;s just say there are some real surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is British and has that good British flavor of acting that was in such TV series like The Avengers.&#34;
b&#39;Ostensibly a story about the young child of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. The kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. They know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a performance at Albert Hall in London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is rich in Hitchcockian incidents. A friendly but opaque Frenchman seems to grill the innocent Stewart -- a doctor from Indiana -- a little too intensely to be merely idly curious. Later the Frenchman shows up in Arab disguise, a knife in his back, and whispers some information about the murder plot to Stewart. Stewart tells his wife -- Doris Day looking very saucy indeed -- but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son\&#39;s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead the couple try to track down the assassins, buy them off, and get their son back, taking them from Morocco, where Hitchcock has given us his usual tourist\&#39;s eye view of the customs, locations, and food, to London. There is a hilarious wild goose chase involving a set-to between Stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop. The staff are more concerned about guarding their half-stuffed specimens than anything else, and they shuffle around protectively holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish. In the course of the scuffle, Stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill, but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger, the action boosted along by Bernard Hermann\&#39;s bumptious score. The scene ends with Stewart rushing out the door. Hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion\&#39;s head gaping at the slammed door. There is also a running gag, well done, about some visitors waiting around the couple\&#39;s hotel room in London, waiting for things to be explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two serious issues that are lightly touched on. One is the relationship between Stewart and Day, which is not as rosy as it ought to be, considered as a bourgeois ideal. She\&#39;s been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known. And she\&#39;s given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc. That\&#39;s understandable in, say, a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right. It isn\&#39;t delved into, but the edginess is noticeable, as it was not in the original version. It reminds me a little of an exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his then-wife Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from entertaining the troops in Korea. &#34;Oh, Joe,&#34; she gushed, &#34;did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer?&#34; &#34;Seventy thousand,&#34; muttered Joe, former hero of the New York Yankees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is one of allegiance. Who is of greater social value? One\&#39;s own young son? Or an unknown ambassador. Do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability? Day is faced with this dilemma in its starkest form at the climax in the Albert Hall. Her solution opts for allegiance to political stability, although her motives are problematic. Does she scream to save the ambassador\&#39;s life, or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her? (Cf: Alec Guiness falling on the detonator at the end of &#34;The Bridge on the River Kwai.&#34;) The photography is extremely good, and the settings can be menacing, even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of London. It\&#39;s mid-day, and Stewart is alone and determined, but frightened too. There are footsteps echoing on Gulliver Street from someone, somewhere. Is he being followed? Is his life in danger? And where the hell is everybody who lives on this street? Hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the bricks beside him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director had a rare disagreement with Francois Truffaut while being interviewed for Truffaut\&#39;s otherwise laudatory book. Truffaut argued that the earlier version of &#34;The Man Who Knew Too Much&#34; lacked the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied, &#34;It seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience,&#34; but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional. No argument there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Hitchcock pretty much near his zenith.&#39;
b&#34;Hey guy, this movies is everything about choices. All the times in your life you must pick something or it just pass away... And this movie prove that! Of course, life in fact is not like a beautiful picture as this movie shows... it not shows indeed but some may figure that. I&#39;m trying to say it&#39;s full of pain, love and deep lessons of live. Aaron, the Mormon missionary is the real shepherd digging out the thing beautiful deep inside Chisthian, the skin feeling guy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a great end and you do always believe in fate because it will surprise you in a turn or in other of your live like Latter Days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big deal watch it!!!&#34;
b&#39;One reasons why they call the 80\&#39;s, &#34;The Awesome 80\&#39;s&#34; is quality television. Shows like the Wonder Years, War of the Worlds (the series), V, Amazing Stories, and many more have always left an impression to each &#34;fortunate&#34; one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself. To top that, here comes Monsters! A series quite unique of its own, and a theme fully dedicate to - monsters. May it be the good, the bad, and the morbid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;re a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you. Provided you can find this rare gem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness, it\&#39;s indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity. I guarantee, because I\&#39;m 23 :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure NOT to miss this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, it\&#39;s a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember...&#39;
b&#34;This is probably one of the best Portuguese movies I ever saw... I absolutely enjoyed the plot, because by the way the story was developing, you would get more involved on how their world was really upside-down... There is just only one part that doesn&#39;t really seem to fit in the movie, which is the girls&#39; strip... It does not add anything important to the story, it looks like it&#39;s just there for a men entertaining purpose. The ending is a bit unexpected, though, at the same time, somewhat expected. If you don&#39;t understand, then follow me: after so many strange occurrences, the viewer is so used to oddities, that ending the movie with totally unexpected relationships (Like Mimoso and Susana) sounds totally natural after seeing the rest of the movie. But, most of all, Sorte Nula is a movie that makes you think hard trying to solve the mysterious occourings, laugh your head off with their unlucky lives and mess with your perception of what can happen in just a few minutes, when you turn your back away from something... for all that, I rate it 8/10&#34;
b&#34;When dirty dancing was on TV in the middle of last year I was out so I didn&#39;t get to see it, my mum swore that I had seen it and that she had it on tape somewhere. Anyway getting to the point she couldn&#39;t find her video so for Christmas I bought her the DVD, well she hasn&#39;t had a look in. It sat around for a while then one night I decided to take it upstairs to watch and I fell in love with it. This is a great film with lots of lovely scenes! I love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it! It&#39;s definitely not for everyone but if you love a love story then you will want to watch Dirty Dancing again and again! Dirty Dancing - The Way Love Is Meant To Be!&#34;
b&#39;China White (1989) was Ronny Yu\&#39;s first international film. This U.K,/Holland/Hong Kong production was shot in English and was slightly edited for the western audience. The American Wong brothers (Michael and Russell) were supposed to star in the film together but due to prior commitments was unavailable so another western actor Steven Leigh took his spot. Several Hong Kong stars such as Tommy Wong (playing a mute) and the always creepy William Ho appear as well as the director in an interesting cameo spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chow brothers are in Holland to run the family business. They want to the family business to go legit but the other Asian gangs don\&#39;t want to and see there move as a face saving move to please the &#34;foreigners&#34; and want to keep on making money the old fashion way. Others want to take their business to even a new low by smuggling drugs and what not. After the Chow elder is gunned down in cold blood, the brothers make their move against any family who\&#39;s not with them. Can the Chow family keep the families from killing one another or while the streets of Holland flow with the blood of the innocence and gangsters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A highly underrated movie. I was surprised by how good it was. I haven\&#39;t seen the Hong Kong version. That would be a huge treat for me. It\&#39;s longer and has a lot more stars of the Hong Kong Cinema involved with the production. Too bad this film isn\&#39;t available on D.V.D. The video print i saw was washed out and the sound reproduction wasn\&#39;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for action fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;factoid: This film takes place before the decriminalization of drugs &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in Holland.&#39;
b&#39;Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is a French gangster movie that doesn\&#39;t try for style. That\&#39;s why it has style. Because the movie is so underplayed and so matter-of-fact, it becomes more and more involving. And because Abel Davos is played by Lino Ventura, we wind up emotionally invested in this taciturn, tough killer who loves his wife and kids, has an encounter with customs agents on the shore near Nice at night that neither he nor we expect, and who proves just as willing to shoot a cop or a betrayer with as little emotion as flicking off a bit of lint. We first meet Davos in Italy with his wife and their two small boys, one about 9 and one 4. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;This man was Abel Davos, sentenced to death in absentia,&#34; we\&#39;re told. &#34;On the run for years, he had watched his resources dwindle, even as his anxiety kept him on the move. With the Italian police closing in each day, France was again his best bet. Maybe he\&#39;d been forgotten.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Davos was a top gangster in Paris who took care of his friends. That was several years ago. A heist to give him money to return to France goes very wrong. Now he\&#39;s hiding out with his two kids. He calls his friends in Paris to help him out. He and his kids need to get from Nice to Paris but the police are hunting him and they\&#39;ve set up roadblocks. For Davos\&#39; two best friends, time has passed and they\&#39;ve moved on. They don\&#39;t want to put themselves at risk, and for what? Obligation gives may to caution. So they hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean- Paul Belmondo), to pick up Davos and the children in an ambulance, then to drive to Paris with Davos heavily bandaged and the children hidden. We\&#39;re on a journey where Davos\&#39; options are increasingly limited, where he must find ways to have his children cared for, where he realizes there are no more ties of friendship, where betrayal seems likely, and where quite possibly his only friend left is Eric Stark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without fussing about. There are no trench coats with pulled-up collars, no toying with the melodrama of the gangster code so many French directors have loved. Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who once was somebody, who now is sliding down to be nobody, and who reacts with violence and resignation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lino Ventura dominates the movie, yet when he is paired with Jean-Paul Belmondo a curious chemistry happens. Ventura as Davos is grim and worried about caring for his sons. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a tough man who sees killing someone, if needed, as just part of the business he\&#39;s in. Belmondo as the young thief who initially is sent to be an expendable driver and winds up being a friend to count on, provides the brightness that keeps the movie from being just one more ride down the elevator. Belmondo was 27 and looks younger. His unlikely star power as a lead actor -- broken nose, under-slung jaw -- shines right off the screen. He makes Erik a match for Ventura when they share a scene. And Belmondo\&#39;s scenes with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes his girl friend, radiate charm and good-natured sex appeal. The ending is bittersweet fate, and without a stylistic posture in sight. We hear Davos say, &#34;Abel\&#39;s gone. There\&#39;s nothing left.&#34; It would be well worth watching Classe tous Risques to learn what he means. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many fine French gangster films. I\&#39;d place this one right there with Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of Lino Ventura\&#39;s finest performances, watch Army of Shadows.&#39;
b&#34;After watching the series premiere of Talk Show with Spike Feresten I took a moment to really think wow there are actually good shows on after 12 besides SNL and I was also sad to see that it was only 30 minutes long. His great writing skills helped this show overcome a series lack of money and helping hands. Electronic Lincoln was hilarious and I really think this will be a good Dark Horse Talk Show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with the way he handled it and gave Andy Richtor some good lines to work with. As you would have suspected it was a little shaky but for that kind of time slot it was very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you are not someone on weed or even if you are and you don&#39;t have something more important to do than watch this great piece and have a fun time doing it.&#34;
b&#34;Valentine, a model in France is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet up in England, but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses. One night after declining a pass made by her coworker, she hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and she returns it to her owner, a hostile retired judge who&#39;s is living as a hermit and eavesdropper, listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours. She becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his eavesdropping games. One conversation the two listen in on is of extreme importance though, the conversation between a young soon to be judge and his wife, which we find out parallels the life of the man who is eavesdropping upon them. As we find out more about the couple, the man reveals more of his story, then continues his story, and we find out if the two men will continue towards the same fate. Little does Valentine know how her life, this encounter and the fate of the young judge will become entangled together. Her hitting the dog that day seemed to be fate, a divine sacrifice by the dog for her owner, allowing Valentine to be the saviour of the young judge, who is traveling the same path as her dear friend, to prevent him from having such a grim future, filled with loneliness and solitude. It seems the old man&#39;s dream will come true after all, and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time! Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema. His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing movies i&#39;ve ever seen. And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome. Usually signified with a subtle pause, or late focus in a scene, see if you can spot some. I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years. I couldn&#39;t think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy! I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art! 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.&#34;
b&#34;I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don&#39;t think this movie was pathetic at all and i&#39;m not just saying that because i&#39;m a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it. i was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and i really enjoyed it and we were talking about it the whole way home! I would tell my other friends to watch this movie. i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the best movie that&#39;s ever hit the box office but it&#39;s a lot better than some people are describing it to be. Everyone has their own opinions so if you really want to know whether it&#39;s good or bad, watch it and then decide.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Don\&#39;t Torture a Duckling&#34; is one of the coolest Italian horror films I\&#39;ve ever seen, and I\&#39;ve seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it\&#39;s not really a typical murder mystery. It\&#39;s more of a straight horror movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci\&#39;s twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect. The finale is genuine and original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing &#34;Don\&#39;t Torture a Duckling&#34; you really have to wonder how Fulci\&#39;s later stuff got so off beat. I like all his stuff, but he strayed. Maybe he figured he already did it...Because with this film, he hits the bullseye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;d recommend this film to anyone who thinks that Dario Argento owns the giallo genre. Fulci beats him with this one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 out of 10, kids.&#39;
b&#34;I have to be honest, I really had a good time watching She&#39;s the Man. Despite it being a typical teenage comedy or if you will the switching of the sexes movie, it had some pretty decent laughs that I think anyone could get. Adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and acts like a guy, and when she is turned down to try out for the boy&#39;s soccer team, she decides to take over her brother&#39;s appearance to prove herself worthy of being on the boy&#39;s soccer team. Of course, love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she&#39;s her brother. She also has a girl who is chasing after her. Well, the tag line says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fun little teen drama that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes did prove something in the film, it&#39;s really hard to really act like a guy. :D Well, it&#39;s true! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&#34;
b&#39;You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a &#34;story.&#34; At first viewing, it\&#39;s even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images. If after this opening, you want to see the movie, you will not be bored. You may even be mesmerized. The movie may be an emotional experience; it may be an intellectual experience; it may be both. Judging from the DVD commentary, which is essential, it was primarily an emotional experience for Herzog, and, at one point, he talks explicitly about how the film is a collaboration between filmmaker and viewer. There\&#39;s plenty of room for the viewer to make of this film exactly what he or she wants to make of it. Take a gamble?&#39;
b&#34;Kramer Vs. Kramer is a near-heartening drama about shocking, drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple. Meryl Streep, in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy stay-at-home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband, in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman, to find another role for herself. Hoffman is dumbstruck, having absolutely no idea what to do with himself, having taken so much for granted that he doesn&#39;t know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks. He is restless, relentless and impatient, but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite, he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to. He&#39;s been focused on his career in advertising, and when he is left to raise his son Billy all by himself, chaos ushers in immediately. He&#39;s the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity. After awhile, as he befriends his neighbor and Joanna&#39;s former friend, played by sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. In the meantime, his boundless energy redirects towards raising Billy and he loses his job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance. Even if the ending is a little unmotivated, subjectified for the audience, the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s.&#34;
b&#39;There is a version of &#34;Nevsky&#34; that is shown with a live symphony orchestra, chorus, soloist and the movie. If it\&#39;s EVER performed within a day\&#39;s travel of you see &#34;Nevsky&#34; done that way. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic did it with the OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the finest anywhere) a couple of years ago. I think I cried through the whole thing, it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life. I\&#39;m listening to &#34;Nevsky&#34; on the radio right now and it still tears me up. There are movies that I love, and classical music pieces I love, but there is no combination I can think of that comes close to the impact of &#34;Nevsky&#34; performed in real time.&#39;
b&#34;Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s twistedly cute clever &amp; dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia&#39;s other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn&#39;t say this Brad is trying to rip him off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is just jumping in &amp; adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate. I like what he does &amp; he does it well, nuff said!&#34;
b&#39;Look...I\&#39;ve come to expect this level of acting from William Macy...the guy just keeps putting in terrific performances...but MEAT LOAF? Just when did His Loafness decide to leave Jim Steinman behind and throw his decidedly lower weight around in the wonderful world of Stanislavsky? Well...what can I say? I\&#39;m duly impressed. To paraphrase an old adage: &#34;It ain\&#39;t the meat, it\&#39;s the emotion&#34;...and the Loaf is quietly buffing up his acting chops of late..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura Dern carries off the 40\&#39;s look perfectly here...great job by the costume and hair departments...David Paymer is typecast but right on the money. Solid camera work throughout the flick. The plot line is reminiscent of &#34;Gentleman\&#39;s Agreement&#34; (post-WWII anti-semitism). Well worth your time...particularly for the growing legions of Bill Macy acolytes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#34;Walter Matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his equal comedy partner Jack Lemmon from THE FORTUNE COOKIE to THE ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films - a female partner. This was Glenda Jackson, the English double Oscar winner, who demonstrated her comic abilities against Matthau&#39;s first in HOUSE CALLS and then in HOPSCOTCH. Matthau&#39;s role was slightly larger in both films, because his characters were more central to the plots, but the chemistry between them was quite good. If you ever want to see two pros demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be crazily funny watch Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old movie code rule of the two parties each having one leg on the floor! Never has sex been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical point of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthau&#39;s Charlie has just been widowed before the film began. He has only had one woman in his life - his wife. So now he&#39;s the eligible bachelor. He also is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of, but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently senile (there are moments later in the film that show he turns his senility on and off - see the scene where he rams Richard Benjamin&#39;s car). Amos is up for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor for the post - if he wants it). However, Amos manages to convince Charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of self-esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day Charlie notices Ann in the hospital. She has had a slight accident and is resting in bed, but Amos has put her into a cage like apparatus (which Charlie remarks has not been used since about 1920). He gets her out of the device, and soon is romancing her. She joins the staff of the hospital, but she is critical of Charlie&#39;s willingness to cater to Amos, and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amos&#39; bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital (Lloyd Gough), who owned a baseball team (his greatest innovation being separate admission costs for double headers). Amos tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner, delivering the eulogy at the burial service (the line in the summary above is the peroration line of the eulogy). However she is still determined to sue (her lawyer Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent he&#39;s ever seen). So Amos suggests that Charlie romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive lawsuit. But how will Ann react to this? The film is quite amusing, and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for Jackson and Matthau, it led to a television series as well.&#34;
b&#39;This review contains what might be a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box. So if you want to approach the movie not knowing anything about it, except that I like it a lot, stop here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The production values are not first rate, but the acting between the leads is, and they give the romance between them more life than Shute does in his novel (although I generally prefer the novel). My very faint objections to the film as opposed to the book is that the film dumbs-down some of the relationships with secondary characters, and between the lead characters in a scene toward the end of the film, to provide for some not at all realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot device. All this is handled much better in the book, with the result that I find the end of the book quite a bit more touching than the end of the movie.&#39;
b&#39;Watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of British screens. It showed a different side of Old Australia that we need to see more of. Good juxtaposition of old hand and young turk. Then the realism of the hard out back was fantastic. It was sadly missed. This show was a cold look at the old way of looking at Australia. Hard living and hard working. The young idealist clashing with the old practical head. Real Politicka fighting with the young upstarts of New Labour. To add modern political vernacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show was the first of its type that I came across that did not try to do a tourist job on Australia. It was a great showing of the realistic &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;come documentary realistic type of show. Some good films were out at the time doing a similar job. It would be great to see more of this type of TV come from Australia for it has been sadly missing this last twenty years. for all we have been fed is the soap pulp of varying quality.&#39;
b&#34;OK. A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian. Be careful about who you see this film with - ie - DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM. I&#39;ll explain why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf, but is annoying 2 - the film itself is really very very disturbing. I have some problems - first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a &#39;horror film&#39;. But it IS a very disturbing film ,and involves a child and his parents, and a small town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, it boils down to this. The film is not suitable for minors, because it contains sequences and images that are unsettling and would be confusing to a child. Is has a bizarre quality to it, and its ONLY because it has a child in it that makes me feel its unsuitable. As a parent myself I feel strongly enough to want to tell people because I read only the other day that it is having a release in theatres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope im not offending the film makers by saying this, but I think its my right, because its getting a release, and has an M rating only.(because its not violent or sexual). Just weird and unsettling but pretty good in and of itself.&#34;
b&#39;If you want an excellent survey of Byzantine history done in colorful fashion, this is for you. This documentary would also be excellent for educators, who are teaching about Roman, or medieval history. This documentary is divided into three portions, first dealing with the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the rise of Christianity and the beginning of the Byzantine Empire. The second video deals with Byzantine diplomacy and the iconoclastic controversy. The third and final video explains the decline and fall of Byzantium. The series is shot in several countries, and beautifully integrates Byzantine history into the realities of the modern world, showing the place of this civilization as part of human civilization in general. Do, take the time to watch.&#39;
b&#34;Just Go see this movie. It taps into everything awesome about rock and roll, the band comes up with some great songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder etc). All this with the Humor of Teancous D makes this the best movie ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cameos are great right of the back, with Meat Loaf and Dio singing to JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are great, I really like Tim Robbins character. You also find out who Satan really is! The Music and Musical references are hilarious and Awesome. Playin songs great songs from The Who, Dio, and others just complete it. i personally didn&#39;t think the band could top the awesome songs of the D, but they did with songs like Classico and Master Exploder. Seriously awesome music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just go see it, its a must for anyone who loves rock!&#34;
b&#34;This movie moves and inspire you, it&#39;s like you are one of the family. Just to see and witness life during the depression era, makes you feel humble and grateful. Jonathan Silverman delivered well, so convincing and very witty! A must see for Teens!&#34;
b&#34;i am surprised so few have good words for this movie. For its time (the 80&#39;s) it was a very entertaining and engaging story. Casting was good. Story was good. Special effects were remarkable for the time period. Deserving of an 8/10.&#34;
b&#34;To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies. Writing is superb. Even though the show is built on one-liners, they don&#39;t become overbearing or annoying. Leslie Nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You ain&#39;t seen nothing yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun. When watching these movies, notice how many schticks are taken from the TV show. The brilliant part is that they don&#39;t have to be changed too much. The show was truly a testing ground for bigger and better versions to come later.&#34;
b&#39;We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Meryl Streep the head of the NSC in the movie says &#34;The United States does not torture&#34; it got a big laugh at this movie. It is of course a lie that the Bush Administration has denied time and again. It is a very good movie and it is scary in what they can do to us as we lose all of our civil rights. They can simply &#34;snatch&#34; you anywhere and tell know one that they have done it. In this case, they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9-11. He is of course just like you or I. And so they take him to a secret location outside of the US to torture and waterboard him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very frightening. Well acted by Jake and Reese and the entire cast.&#39;
b&#34;When I saw this movie at age 6, it was in the CHILDRENS&#39; section at Erols Video because it was animation. We watched it and it was a whole different ball game! A very violent story and graphic deaths are VERY entertaining and compelling, but not for children. Avoid for family viewing, my mom nearly had a heart attack and ripped the video apart!&#34;
b&#39;If you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. But if you are strongly interested in seeing a rare piece of wartime animation, come on in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this cartoon, Popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what looks like a Japanese fishing boat. The two Japanese fishermen trick Popeye into thinking that they want a peace treaty signed. But looks can be deceiving; the fishing boat turns out to be a Japanese navy ship! What follows is considered today to be morale-boosting propaganda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned, the representations of the Japanese in the film are done in a mean-spirited fashion. Keep in mind, though, that there was a war going on at the time. But I strongly recommend this cartoon to those who are interested in the WWII era.&#39;
b&#34;This is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province. It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture, to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived, breathed, and ate everything Maurice Richard. The book does this as well as the short, and I&#39;m glad that in all the time I did spend studying French in high school, this was required reading in both languages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier narrate this story. His molasses-thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story. The animation was good, as well, very surrealist, which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream, fancying over better days gone by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, as a symbol of culture quebecoise, this is unsurpassed. One can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove. This whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be Canadian, and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots. I&#39;m from Ontario, and this film made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs.&#34;
b&#39;Yet another in the long line of &#34;Don\&#39;t&#34; films of the late 70\&#39;s and early 80\&#39;s yet this one is much more than that. This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist. It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it\&#39;s the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors/actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens\&#39; progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be. It seems Dr. Masters, a rather ambitious female doctor, has taken over his duties and begun to implement her own ideas. Each of the patients take on their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and flaws which make for highly entertaining interactions. There is the nymphomaniac, the crazy old crone, the woman with an unhealthy obsession with infants, and a man who has reverted back to his childhood among others. There is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients running around loose and bodies piling up. If you are a fan of cheap 70\&#39;s sleaze than this is the film for you!&#39;
b&#39;The Internet is a wondrous thing is it not? I am watching a taped episode of one of my all time favorite documentaries, &#34;Vietnam:The Ten Thousand Day War&#34;, from my DVR in Florida USA to my laptop in Kuwait; I\&#39;m writing a review about this series and have just read another review from someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I would like to just say that for Minh Nguyen to make the statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one sided. I know America was the main player in the west but it takes two sides to wage war. The Soviets and the Chinese were major arms providers to the North so why Mr Nguyen doesn\&#39;t mention them as partially to blame is showing an ignorance (well, I think we all know why he doesn\&#39;t mention them, either ignorance from being raised in a communist system and its political dogma, or because he to scared to say the truth for fear of being arrested.). Also, Mr Nguyen, I guess the parts about the North being the main aggressor it whole war were not shown in your country so to blame America again shows ignorance. Regardless, its interesting to read a review from Vietnam (of course that could be made up as well but I\&#39;ll take that as real), at least the communist east is somewhat open. As far as the mini series; why do I love it? It doesn\&#39;t focus on the American involvement solely. This was a war that started 15 years before America got involved and the series covers every facet of the history so thats a real plus. The footage used is first rate, all the Vietnam War programs you see made now will use the same footage so you are not missing anything by watching this older series. The date this series was made is another plus. It has all the major players being interviewed which you can\&#39;t do now because they are dead from old age, it\&#39;s a major historical reference. Third, Richard Basehart adds a very distinctive narrative voice, his voice sounds as distinguished as James Earl Jones voice would and I think thats very steep praise. I don\&#39;t think you could find a better war documentary ever made, it\&#39;s like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 and transplanting it to the year 1950 and interviewing all the generals and politicians on both sides of world war two, it does that for the Vietnam War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I do see some bias, its subtle, a 1970\&#39;s-80\&#39;s style subtle bias kind of like NPR &#34;All Things Considered&#34; bias where it all seems so straight forward but when you blink you end up shaking your head. In this shows case the later episodes don\&#39;t throw a whole lot of light on the role of the media and propaganda in general, all useful tools to influence the outcome of a war, DON\&#39;T YOU THINK????? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an OIF War Veteran going through the same thing 30 years later.&#39;
b&#39;(Spoilers warning) I cannot say enough good things about this movie. It is a great horror comedy/spoof that does everything right for a change. The humor is great and ranges from funny to so-funny-you\&#39;ll-cry funny. In one scene, Ed goes edit-crazy and deletes a big scene. When his boss is looking at Ed\&#39;s edit, he yells out: &#34;Where in the fu%# is my beaver-rape scene?!?!&#34; Hysterical. There are also many other great, humorous &amp; memorable quotes and moments throughout: Ed yells out &#34;Don\&#39;t you fu#$ing look at me!!!&#34; while punching some poor schmuck repeatedly in the face. Very funny stuff. The plot of the movie itself is so ridiculous that it\&#39;s priceless: Ed is a mild-mannered everyday guy that gets moved over to the horror-film editing department, and after a while goes nuts, sees monsters, and attacks people while quoting the horror movies that he has edited. This movie has it all and is simply hilarious. The DVD only costs about $7, and is a great bargain as it is the unrated widescreen cut. I own a lot of DVD\&#39;s, most of which cost a lot more money than this one, but not many are as great as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights of my collection and i would beat someone with a telephone receiver if they tried to steal it. Evil Ed oozes style and quality -- something that Hollywood filmmakers need to majorly learn. Evil Ed is a rare gem, and i would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie -- you did everything right, and i love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10!!!&#39;
b&#34;Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford&#39;s work. Mainly because it&#39;s the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director&#39;s son \xc2\x96 Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director&#39;s personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve&#39;, to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wagon Master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a John Ford&#39;s film. Wonderful cast delivering his best, thou not featuring any major stars, except the most `fordian&#39; of all actors \xc2\x96 Ben Johnson. Very peculiar small characters, who provide an obligatory comic relief, and Wagon Master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing Sister Ledyard (Jane Darwell) in her shot but very inspired gigs. And last but not least legendary Monument Valley with John Ford&#39;s fifth passage through it after Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The film starts with two friends cowboys Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr) being hired to be Wagon Masters or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers who are headed to Silver Valley, a place that&#39;s for them like a promised land. On their way they are joined by a very peculiar Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women, who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. They are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into Cleggs, a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the Marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall Wagon Master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of John Ford&#39;s wonderful Westerns. A must see. 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#34;The Best Years of Our Life is often compared to It&#39;s a Wonderful Life. They never should be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. It is hard to know what value individual life may have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What a statistic we have to live with.) Also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a life long pacifist. I oppose all war. Not long ago I had that position tested. It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which I live. It is a powerful experience, moving around on her decks. She had seen a great deal of action. Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot watch The Best Years of Our Life without thinking about things like the Lexington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they paid mine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one of them got off any easier than any other. The Navy, Air Force and Army paid equally although in different ways. Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moving part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don&#39;t hesitate, do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife \xc2\x96 standard fair for 30&#39;s/40&#39;s films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al&#39;s daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That&#39;s perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about. This is not a film for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people. We ought to be careful that we don&#39;t abuse that privilege.&#34;
b&#39;A Great show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, to the people who don\&#39;t like it..Don\&#39;t like it, then DON\&#39;T WATCH IT...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is(was) an awesome show. Better than According to Jim (A favorite of mine). It shows a REAL family household (As opposed to 8 simple rules,etc, where everything goes peachy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They\&#39;re loud, they\&#39;re messy....I can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen. It happens in real life..Sorta like the &#34;Portal to hell&#34;, and everyone growling like dogs over the fast-food boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a &#34;Been there&#34; show....You know what\&#39;s coming, but fun to watch, because YOU have been there before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good cast, they work great together, a admirable enough show to warrant a DVD release. Mel Gibsons &#34;Safety videos&#34; were a highlight of the series as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opinion? Good show, REALLY deserving of a DVD release (Deserving to not be canceled as well).&#39;
b&#39;the scarlet coat is about bendict arnold betraying his country but he really isn\&#39;t in the movie too much the main focus is on major Boulton (cornell wilde) and major Andre (micheal wilding)Wilding steals the movie as a officer and a gentlemen also as a freind to Boulton. As Boulton tries to uncover who is gustavus the man leaking secerts to the british.Wilde has to deal with the british the suspisous Dr o&#34;dell(George Sanders)who watches his every move and love intrest Anne Francis this is a very enjoyable movie&#39;
b&#39;My companions were astounded to find that this movie was a documentary. It was so funny, it seemed scripted, yet it gives a stirring picture of real life in the indie film life. We felt moved to purchase Coven and wanted to meet Mark and Mike. As college students, this film gave us a much needed glimpse of real life.&#39;
b&#39;You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed. Or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of &#34;judgement&#34;); that layer is completely uninteresting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of Duvall\&#39;s one-liners, but that\&#39;s just a coating for commercial mastication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can try to view this as a \&#39;realistic\&#39; Vietnam war film, but ask any veteran and he\&#39;ll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or view it as a \&#39;will he or won\&#39;t he\&#39; morality play -- nothing rich there, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I found the value was in the superb self-reference. Coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing \&#39;a great man\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brando the man was as much of a maverick as the Kurtz character. The studios were uncomfortable with his acting \&#39;method\&#39;, yet he always excelled and won accolades; the \&#39;generals\&#39; are uncomfortable with Kurtz\&#39;s \&#39;unsound methods\&#39;, in spite of his strategic genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Coppola makes a movie all about Brando\&#39;s greatness. To hammer on the point, he places himself in the movie (as Hopper, a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises. Brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the actor\&#39;s power. And he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: &#34;the horror...&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives, including \&#39;being in the firefight\&#39; long before &#34;Private Ryan&#34;; the ground breaking use of sound, notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference.&#39;
b&#39;I just wanted to write a quick response to all those people who give this film a bad review because they think it isn\&#39;t funny or that it\&#39;s boring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here\&#39;s the trick --- the film is not meant to be just a comedy. It\&#39;s got some depth to it. Like many Demme films it deals with people living in some of the odd corners of our society who are trying to work out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the movie and home video industries don\&#39;t deal well with subtlety and drop this in the &#34;COMEDY&#34; bin. It IS funny, but a lot of the humor is off-beat. However, the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be one of the greatest films in the world but it is solid and entertaining. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art unto itself. Michelle Pfieffer is great and this may be the film that showed she had some acting chops to add to her beauty. Mercedes Ruehl is a big hoot and gets to chew the scenery in the way only she can, in a role which requires it. Throw in Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you\&#39;ve got a great cast throughout which here, as usual, makes a great difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthew Modine is fun, but more important, he\&#39;s a major hottie in this movie. Hot, cute and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sit back, expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time.&#39;
b&#39;Messiah was compulsive viewing from start to finish. The story centred on apparently random murders of men in London in various gruesome ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott)has to find the truth which, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he might think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gripping drama and Ken Stott was brilliant. Hopefully we have not seen the last of DCI Red Metcalfe.&#39;
b&#39;Although the premise of the movie involves a major &#34;coincidence,&#34; the actors all do a creditable job and look great bringing the story to life. I found myself rooting for the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti, empathizing with both, and wanting them to reconcile. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are fine in their roles as well, doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship. While the story tends to leap through time, occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. This interesting storyline has all the elements for a good &#34;chick flick.&#34;&#39;
b&#39;I liked the movie but it should have been longer. The actors did a great job. Portia De Rossi is a fabulous actress and Kristoffer Polaha is a hottie. He didn\&#39;t look like John at 100% but he did favor him from a distance. I look forward to seeing more of him on the big screen. He didn\&#39;t have john\&#39;s charisma, but he definitely has a charm about himself. He has beautiful eyes and a great smile. He reminds me of my boyfriend alot. Ms. Bissett was just too breathy for me. She should have that asthma checked out. Im not going to comment on the Darryl Hannah character. My mom always said, &#34;If ya can\&#39;t say anything nice, then shut the hell up!&#34; so that\&#39;s what Im gonna do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly&#39;
b&#34;Xavier,a French student moves into an apartment in Barcelona with a cast of six other characters from all over Europe. An Italian, a Danish, a German, a British, a Spanish and a Belgium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants to get a job in EU with the help of his father&#39;s friend. He says there are jobs here a lot, but if you know Spanish and Spanish market. So, he advice him to go Spain. Xavier gets an Eramus grand and fly to Barcelona by living his girlfriend and mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He first learns that the house he will stay is no longer available and the small rooms in Barcelona are even more expensive than he thinks. He stays in a French couples house while he was looking for a house. He has been interviewed with the 5 people from the house and has been accepted. He had an affair with this French guys lovely wife and totally messed up everything with his problematic girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to hear more? Did you travel abroad for education? Watch this movie, I promise that you will have a very nice time.&#34;
b&#39;I just saw it at an advance screening I haven\&#39;t read the book, but heard many good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie was absolutely fantastic, very moving. With a roller coaster of emotions you totally connect with the characters. Shaun Toub was great, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his acting for those who understand Persian/Dari was incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to notes it that Khaled Hosseini actually loved the film which is unusual for book adaptation movies. Even after seeing the movie several times &#34;he was sobbing&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the animation from the intro was exquisite, with names displayed as if it were Persian calligraphy, very unique! At times the translation was not clearly conveying the message efficiently, but all in all this was a great movie.&#39;
b&#34;Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It&#39;s Werner Herzog&#39;s most unconventional film. It doesn&#39;t have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we&#39;re given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It&#39;s not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren&#39;t actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror. The use of music in this movie is so brilliant - from Leonard Cohen, Mozart, and the Third Ear Band. Imagine Stanley Kubrick&#39;s 2001: A Space Odyssey in the desert; that&#39;s what this movie is like. This film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as though your spirit has left your body. A must see. It will change the way you view films. Rating: 10 out of 10.&#34;
b&#34;Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a while. It&#39;s an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn&#39;t want to go to the pub because the villagers don&#39;t like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says &#39;To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor. Grace is one of Kathy Bates&#39; best roles. Meredith Eaton steals just about every scene that she is in. Rupert Everett does some of his finest work in Unconditional as Dirk. The Kiss between Rupert and Meredith took me to another bout of hysterics. In this day and age of Gay rights being questioned, I think this movie should be seen by all. As a gay Man in my late 40&#39;s I have seen people lose everything when a loved one dies. So kudo&#39;s to all involved in the making of this film.&#34;
b&#39;ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL\&#39;S / (2001) *** (out of four)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Blake French:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\tAccording to Harald Zwart, the director of &#34;One Night at McCool\&#39;s,&#34; this film is &#34;a dark comedy about the power of women over men, and how a group of people can all perceive different realities. It\&#39;s the same story told from three different points of view, and each time we tell the story, we try to reveal a little bit more about what actually happened, which nobody really knows.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\t&#34;One Night at McCool\&#39;s&#34; marks the feature film directorial debut of Zwart, an award winning commercial and music video director who began making short films when he was eight years old. I always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos turns to filmmaking. We have seen so many examples of how these guys think they are making another advertisement or music video for TV with their productions. Zwart resists that tendency. He captures a specific humorous truth in &#34;One Night at McCool\&#39;s,&#34; from an inventive, complex screenplay by the late Stan Seidel, even if it is often somewhat perplexing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\t&#34;One Night At McCool\&#39;s&#34; features three men who share their separate experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman. In some ways, this movie is the comedy version of &#34;American Beauty,&#34; but in others, it is a world apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\t&#34;It all started one night at McCool\&#39;s&#34; explains each of the three men to their various listeners. There is Randy (Matt Dillon), a tender at the local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser), who stays until the place closes. Detective Dehling (John Goodman), arrives when the saloon becomes the crime scene of the dead boyfriend of a female fatal appropriately named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her, as an individual treats her unkindly. He stands up for her, and before you can say SEXY, they are having vigorous sex and she moves in with him. At first, Randy is reluctant: &#34;The sex and the violence, all in one night \xc2\x96 it\&#39;s a little much.&#34; But who could turn a jewel like Jewel away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\tJewel changes the lives of each of the three men. For Detective Dehling, she pulls him out of a hole of grief since his wife died. For Carl, she makes him forget his loving family and nice little suburban household. For Randy, she lights a few fires, both positive and negative, the later persuading him to contact a bingo playing hit man named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to put an end to her deceptive ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is interesting how the movie perceives the three different chronicles-even the costuming of Jewel is relative to the man telling the story. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful, mesmerizing gift from God. Carl sees Jewel as two sexy legs and lots of cleavage. Randy is unsure what to make of her, an awakening to his otherwise boring, road to nowhere life. The most intriguing element of this movie is Jewel herself, however, deliciously played by the always delightful Liv Tyler (&#34;Armageddon&#34;). She is not really interested in the men, but what they can offer her. Her motives are all too simple, not truthfully diabolical or evil; she is simply a young lady who has learned at an early age that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\tThe film has a lot of fun with its material. From the enthusiastically entertaining cast, to its violently hilarious showdown, &#34;One Night at McCool\&#39;s&#34; takes advantage of most of its humorous ideas. What makes the movie even funnier is how the three men\&#39;s points of view differ. The actors have a lot of fun with their characters, too. Goodman is curiously whimsical; Reiser fits his kinky, squirmy part quite well; Douglas is sly and mysterious in one of the movie\&#39;s funniest performances; Dillon gives his character arrogant personality, even though Randy is a lackluster nobody; Liv Tyler is dazzling. She injects Jewel with the perfect amount of boastful charisma and tantalizing wit. She reminds us of Mena Suvari\&#39;s intimate performance in &#34;American Beauty.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\t&#34;One Night at McCool\&#39;s&#34; is the first film to come from Michael Douglas\&#39; new production company, Furthur Films. It is a creative, genuine, and sexy production. Along the way we often become caught up in the twisty structure, but that is a natural response to a movie that intentionally interweaves several angles to a single story. The movie ends on a note that is both black and comedic. This is another one of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way; i.e., the black comedy. Many films of this genre come across as either too black or too lackadaisical. &#34;One Night at McCool\&#39;s&#34; is one of the few that actually work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#34;Many films attempt the ambitious. Few succeed. This film is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though billed as a black comedy, that term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind Max and Grace. Multi-hyphenate Michael Parness has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotion. Quite a remarkable feat, to be certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the comedic aspects are certainly present, the heart of the film lies in its leads: David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. The delicate balance of the film - really crazy versus real love - falls to them and they achieve it, carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to the heartwarming ending. David Krumholtz, in the titular lead role and as narrator, anchors the picture and does an exceptional job. We see the world through Max&#39;s eyes and Krumholtz imbues them with a sort of wonder and hopefulness that one would not expect to be believable coming from a character who had previously attempted suicide. There should be no doubt from this point on that he has truly achieved leading man status, well deserved after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles. Natasha Lyonne might be something of a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less challenging roles. The role of Grace is expansive in scope, requiring her to show both great rage and great tenderness - sometimes within seconds of each other. She manages to convince us of Grace&#39;s deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and mania.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a laugh a minute type of comedy so don&#39;t see the film expecting strictly humor from start to finish. Think more dramedy than comedy. There are some very dark moments, as one would expect given the subject matter of suicidal individuals, and some oddly real moments delivered most notably by Emma Adele Galvin as Max&#39;s sister, Sis. The most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name actors in supporting roles. While Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer lend the most surreal aspect with their scenes the other supporting characters who populate the institution where Max and Grace meet are the real treat. Guillermo Diaz is a wanton scene stealer as the delightfully frenetic oddball, Hector. Ralf Moeller, as Bruno, acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal. Rosanna Arquette fully inhabits the role of Vera with the crass vitriol of an embittered truck stop waitress. Even her hardhearted character melts eventually, as does everyone who is touched by Max&#39;s literally undying love for Grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can love conquer all might be the question behind the film and even though the realist within says no, movies are about an escape from reality, even if only for a few brief hours. I recommend seeing this film as an antidote to not just reality but to the cynicism that says that a love story like this never happens. Spending a few hours immersed in a world where it can and does works wonders on the psyche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Seattle International Film Festival - June 2005)&#34;
b&#39;Okay, so I love silly movies. If you enjoy silly sci-fi movies, over the top movies, or if you are a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, i would go see this movie. This movie is all that i wanted it to be. Being a fan of over the top movies, this fit the bill. Every time i thought to myself &#34;this movie would be the sillest, best movie ever if *blank* would happen....&#34; then just as i thought it, *blank* would happen. It\&#39;s a wonderful silly \&#39;b\&#39;-movie. If you are a fan of Campbell i\&#39;d say \&#39;see it\&#39;, bring your friends, laugh at it. It\&#39;s fun. It\&#39;s not classic, or anything, but if it\&#39;s on TV some night, watch it. It has become, for me, a movie i would file under &#34;indulgent movies&#34;. Movies that may not be good, but after a hard day of work, i could come home and watch, (this list also includes \&#39;harold and kumar go to white castle\&#39;, \&#39;army of darkness\&#39;, and \&#39; Intolerable Cruelty\&#39; ) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you feel like a over the top, wonderfully slightly bad movie, watch this. if not, go rent &#34;Bubba Ho-tep&#34;&#39;
b&#39;Leaving aside the drawbacks and deficiencies of the film mentioned by other viewers I must say that it seemed to me a film about power,which is in my opinion one of the most luring illusions. I saw the drama of an emperor and people. It seems to me that the director wanted to pose a question of what the benefit of nation is and what the price of &#34;happiness&#34; for all is. Is there justification for the enforced benefit and &#34;happiness&#34;? How much can be forfeited for the nation\&#39;s security and peaceful existence? Is the idea of a powerful would-be empire worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of its citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time the film runs. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to half hate his subjects for having to renounce his father and his love, half love the people as a good emperor should. No wonder his actions are controversial and emotions confused. It seems to me that as another film presenting the problem of power of man over other men the film is a success.&#39;
b&#39;A crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) who is desperately urged by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use her therapy on Carl Stargher (Vincent D\&#39;Ofornio), a serial killer who (uses strange and horrifying torture tactics) is found in a coma by the feds. What Novak wants in return from Deane is whereabouts of Stargher\&#39;s latest victim is and if she\&#39;s alive. Once Deane gets into Stargher\&#39;s mind, which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of David Lynch\&#39;s &#34;Dune&#34; or &#34;Blue Velvet&#34; and Wes Craven\&#39;s &#34;A Nightmare on Elm Street&#34;, the adventure begins. Deane sees a variety of odd people ranging from Carl as a youngster (an adorable Jake Thomas) to a Freddy Krueger-like man minus the razor claws. I don\&#39;t want to give away the ending, but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances, Howard Shore\&#39;s creepy musical score and directing (by Tarsem, who shows here that he can direct).&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Talk Radio&#34; is my favorite Oliver Stone movie, though he has made many great ones including &#34;Salvador&#34;, &#34;JFK&#34;, &#34;Natural Born Killers&#34; and &#34;Platoon&#34;. But I like the intimacy of &#34;Talk Radio&#34;, a cinematic expansion of Eric Bogosian\&#39;s searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a Dallas talk show host. Working with ace cinematographer Robert Richardson, Stone turns what could have been a very set-bound exercise into a visually arresting ideological battle that presents a radio station as an arena of war. Bogosian is devastating as tortured on-air spouter of abuse Barry Champlain and conveys the conflicted, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing. Alec Baldwin, as his Alpha male boss, strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture. Ellen Greene is fantastic as Barry\&#39;s sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol. Stone and Bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. John C. McGinley, as Barry\&#39;s long-suffering screener/technical producer Stu, turns in a hilarious, sharp performance, as does the great Michael Wincott. The film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of superb writing, awesome acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. The Stewart Copeland score is brilliant, too.&#39;
b&#34;So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We&#39;re all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clich\xc3\xa9d but still true, know what I&#39;m saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I&#39;m more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France. She seems like a cool chick in the movie and for real, after I saw her hosting the Cannes Festival last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#39;m thinking I wanna go to Barcelona next summer after seeing this movie. I gotta check out the sequel too which just came out here in France.&#34;
b&#39;I saw this 1997 movie because I am a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and of his father, the late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion, Lorenzo looked his best in this film, mostly due to his hairstyle and the preppy wardrobe that were flattering to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the plot progressed, I realized the movie was more than just entertainment or a reason to see a favorite actor. The story was about a ring of serial killers and the attempts of law enforcement to investigate the ring and bring the members to justice. There was adequate suspense, and I believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the film I was shocked to learn the film is the true account of horrendous murders that occurred in Utah. Furthermore, Lorenzo and his leading lady were portraying actual FBI agents who solved the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the apprehension of the ring. I believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.&#39;
b&#34;as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate - apparently not so much space for opinions in between. I for one think that is a good sign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always appreciated this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (I never watched Titanic for instance, and am not planning to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The English Patient grips because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are &#39;home&#39; (Katherine), it shows how destructive love can be in a slow, strong and utterly painful way, it excites because of the extremely passionate affair, the pain of the one(s) who leave behind, how pointless one can feel to move on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photography is just stunning, not to mention the play of the actors. The pace is slow, but timely, and that does justice to the book, the timeline, and the depth/development of the characters. To put this in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amputate the multi-layeredness of this movie. People tend to have difficulties with the pace of movies... as if they are in a rush to get to work.. hey - get a life ! ;-) enjoy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this movie 4.5 out of 5.&#34;
b&#34;I know a lot of people have said don&#39;t bother with this movie because its not a good fighting flick and hard with the subtitles. That is a really lazy way to think of a movie. If you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else, and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art, this being a masterful piece of work. If you want to watch this, its not about the fighting really. There are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work, but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part. This is not the basic Kung-fu movie. The story is really the central focus and not the fights, and the combination of the two make an excellent movie thats well worth watching, and is even better in the original language with subtitles.&#34;
b&#39;One of my favorites. As a child, growing up in the NY Metro area in the late 60s and early 70s, I was often afforded the opportunity to visit NYC with my grandfather or father, as they conducted business there. The gritty, bustling, human, reality of that city, particularly in winter, have stayed with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film very aptly captures the stark, cold, matter-of-fact feel of the NYC winter season, while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region\&#39;s infamous underworld of crime and policing. A great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the car chase is simply amazing. At least on par with the one in &#34;Bullitt&#34;, and surpassing the chase in &#34;The French Connection&#34;. I can watch, time and again, as the suspension comes unstuck on that Plymouth Fury police cruiser barreling toward the GW Bridge in pursuit, as it lurches into that sharp right curve, bouncing and scraping into oncoming traffic. The stunt driving coordinator for that scene did &#34;Bullitt&#34; and &#34;The French Connection&#34; as well as many other noatable movie chases. Good acting, too, and a decent plot line. The musical score is edgy and compelling, and the cinematography and direction are top notch. A great, if underrated 1970s cop drama. A keeper. Not out on DVD yet, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparable in style and content to: The French Connection and Super Fly. Early 1970\&#39;s cop dramas set in the bleak NYC winter months.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Knute Rockne All American&#34;, the biopic about the famous Notre Dame beloved coach Knute Rockne, is an excellent sports film to watch. Not ever having seen it, we were surprised by the technique used in the movie by director Lloyd Bacon, who shows he was ahead of his times in photographing football games. The result is a vibrant picture about the man responsible for the legacy of the collegian sport, Knute Rockne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film presents Rockne from his humble origins in Chicago to his studies in famed Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana. He was an ambitious man who had a vision about how the game should be played. Luckily, he went to give his beloved Notre Dame the glory he was after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat O\&#39;Brien looks a bit older when he starts as a freshman. In fact, he doesn\&#39;t change much throughout the film, but he is fine as Mr. Rockne. Pat O\&#39;Brien shows he could inspire the players under him by just being a father figure. Gale Page plays Bonnie Rockne, the wise woman who understood her husband\&#39;s call in life. Ronald Reagan plays George &#34;The Gipper&#34; Gipp, who was a legend that died much too young, but who left a legacy behind. Donald Crisp makes a good contribution as Father John Callahan who was Rockne\&#39;s mentor at the university.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film will delight not only sports because of LLoyd Bacon\&#39;s direction and the fast pace he gives to the movie.&#39;
b&#34;I don&#39;t understand all these bad reviews. I believe this movie was one of the best in the Puppet Master series. Being made on a low budget, one can comprehend why the special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg Sestero brought a lot of charisma to the role of Andre Toulon. He has a lot of potential, and I hope to see more of him soon. And though the cinematography was not excellent, and there was minimal violence and gore, this film was a lot of fun. I am a big Puppet Master fan and have grown to expect blood and gore from the films of this series, but I can say that I was never bored through the entire course of watching Retro Puppet Master. So, if you ever get an opportunity to see this movie, don&#39;t automatically regard it as unworthy of your time. Give it a chance. You might like it.&#34;
b&#34;Before I saw this film, I read the comment of someone who wasn&#39;t very fond of it. This I must admit made me apprehensive to dedicate 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life to it, but I&#39;m glad I did. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor, I especially loved the Believer. Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film presented an interesting view on life and death. It was very touching and very sad, yet it kept me interested, which most touching stories cannot do. It is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it, you should see it. It was unique,and I don;t think that anyone will ever be able to duplicate it. All of the young actors did surprisingly well given the subject matter and the emotion that must have gone into it. I was pleasantly surprised.&#34;
b&#34;First, let me say that I find films like Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile, and most of Spielberg to be absolutely horrid and stomach turning. Although, National Velvet on the surface would seem to be in the same genre and has what should be cringe-worthy moments, I thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing and bawling throughout the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The premise of the plot, a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the Grand National is certainly as implausible as could be, but it is the only thing that you have to accept for it to work as a fairy tale or allegory. The characters have depth and grow throughout the story. Ann Revere gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever depicted in an American film. Her interaction with the good-hearted Donald Crisp is funny and sweet. While Liz Taylor tries a bit too hard to be even cuter than Margaret O&#39;Brien (she succeeds btw), her passion and love for her horse shines through her face. Mickey Rooney gives a beautifully nuanced performance of the trainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is far from a perfect movie. Some of the situations and scenes are a bit corny and dated (the kids&#39; antics, and Rooney&#39;s scenes at the track and in the pub for example) but it doesn&#39;t matter. The plot remains true to the characters and leaves quite a bit unsaid. We don&#39;t have unnatural overly dramatic and preachy moments - sometimes more is less. The final scene is a great example of this - the emotional dialog is left to the viewer to fill in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong understated performances, rounded characters, pithy dialog, intelligent and internally consistent storyline. We believe in the characters and are moved by their story. Yup - they just don&#39;t make them like this any more...&#34;
b&#34;Just watched this and it was amazing. Was in serious doubt about renting the DVD or not. So if you are...and like watching other than brainless action-movies...don&#39;t hesitate any longer. Don&#39;t let the dull cover put you off. The script is one of the best ever. Inteligent, funny, original, touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat through the whole movie. I had already watched another movie right before this one and was really sleepy, and usually I get bored on watching a second movie in one night, but this one really made me wake up and didn&#39;t have any boring moments. It also made me rethink a lot of things in life and gave me a really good feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the acting is great (one of Kevin Spacey&#39;s best roles). The visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well-chosen. If I have to come up with something negative to say about it....well....I can&#39;t really find anything......Enjoy! 10 out of 10&#34;
b&#39;All in all, an excellent movie from that time and source (coming from Warner Brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before WWII), provided you don\&#39;t take it at all seriously. The movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate, and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say, JFK. (This one may actually be more honest about it, though, as it essentially admits along the way that it\&#39;s not to be taken as particularly fact-based, but more of a stylishly semi-heroic portrayal.) It\&#39;s worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today; the NY Times review conceded that audiences would &#34;dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film,&#34; described the biographical account of Custer\&#39;s life as &#34;fanciful,&#34; and pointed out that the presentation of Custer\&#39;s motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts. They could have really gone overboard in building up Custer, one supposes, but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around, but appropriately determined, principled and inspirational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flynn and DeHavilland, doing their 8th movie together in 7 years (and their last), are so comfortable together, and play off each other so easily at this point, that it\&#39;s not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here. With a first-time pairing, it would be hard to imagine what could really draw Elizabeth to Custer, but these two make it work. The movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together (the greatly underrated Michael Curtiz), but given that he had worked with them on the previous year\&#39;s similar-themed Santa Fe Trail, it\&#39;s understandable if he chose to opt out of this one. (They all started together with Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade - both terrific - so we can\&#39;t really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raoul Walsh, the director here, is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences - which are outstanding - and everything else outdoors. The interior scenes are a little more uneven, but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well, as does Warner Bros\&#39; outstanding cast of &#34;usual suspects&#34; and new faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc). I would have liked it better if Kennedy\&#39;s character had been a bit less standard (I generally like his work), but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene; the part could have been better written - and I suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle, as he\&#39;d only been in films for one year (Walsh probably took him for this after doing High Sierra together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Various highlights include the depiction (probably imagined) of the genesis of &#34;Garryowen&#34; as the cavalry theme. The last half hour is particularly outstanding, especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership, followed by the final battle scenes. A thoroughly rousing adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 of 10&#39;
b&#39;&#34;L\&#39;Auberge Espagnole&#34; collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. &#34;L\&#39;Auberge Espagnole&#34; is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona. In Spain it turns out that the lectures are being given in Catalonian language. That probably doesn\&#39;t help the increasement of knowledge. But it helps in tightening the relationships inside the group of foreign exchange students. Especially if they rent a big flat together. There are 3 girls: English, Belgian and Spanish, as well as three boys: German, Danish and Italian. Our French guy will also get there. A year is a very long time. Long enough to get close and make friends. And get to know some European stereotypes while trying to break them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Klapisch treats this special case of a process of uniting Europe with humor and without pecky didactism. He comes out of the idea that young people are everywhere just the same. They like jokes. They like to make irresponsible relationships. But they don\&#39;t neglect their aspirations. The most interesting is the sum of experience of this little community. They live together in the fire of everyday tasks fighting with the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual ideas for life. Young Europeans come back to their countries to take up a life of an adult on their own. They are Europe\&#39;s hope to fight the many problems of the Union. For example, the terrifying administration system. In the end they proof that not only can they communicate and make friends despite the many differences. But they also now how to live the full of life. And they won\&#39;t allow taking that full of life away from them.&#39;
b&#39;Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock, it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry. It is likely a sign of how ahead of his time Hitchcock was, always attempting to push the envelope, and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining, but always with a deeper, more poignant motive on his mind. Strangers on a Train, one of Hitchcock\&#39;s first and more underrated hits, is a perfect example of these traits - an entertaining and suspenseful story, even when viewed over 50 years later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arguably one of the pioneering &#34;suspense thrillers&#34;, Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects, but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 (if perhaps slightly less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick, careful editing are what really make the film stand out, drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audience\&#39;s focus even in slower scenes. If there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was, simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments; every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed, all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion. Sadly enough, there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing - Bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable, and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film\&#39;s most tense and engaging scene. These are only brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise. As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clich\xc3\xa9e after clich\xc3\xa9e, it\&#39;s wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original. Sure it\&#39;s fairly straightforward, but the concept of &#34;swapping murders&#34; is simply one that would not fly in films of today\&#39;s day and age, which makes it all the more entertaining to watch; the film\&#39;s brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while. One can\&#39;t help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well, especially the concept of &#34;darkness in humanity\&#39;s heart&#34;, demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno\&#39;s own cavalier attitude towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour (Bruno popping a child\&#39;s balloon with his cigarette is priceless), and irony, shooting suspenseful scenes in happy, easy-going environments, such as the iconic carnival scenes, to create an even more eerie atmosphere. This may be a suspense thriller, yes, but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The antagonistic figure of Bruno (essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker, sadly in his last film role, but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members) is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable, as the character is a marvel to behold. Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure, all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems. Rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment, Bruno is a calm, controlled, psychotic mess. He speaks of murder in such an offhand tone, yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people. Bruno could seem to represent the &#34;Id&#34;, as Freud would put it, the inner, darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind. It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure, Guy Haines, and how bland and uninteresting he seems, almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet despite this implied message, Hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn, and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome. It\&#39;s a testament to actor Farley Granger\&#39;s talent that despite Robert Walker\&#39;s villain easily stealing the show, Granger\&#39;s hero still comes across as sympathetic, still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character. Superb support is given by Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome the clich\xc3\xa9e and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure, Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guy\&#39;s horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that she is far more talented than being simply &#34;the director\&#39;s daughter&#34; would imply. The superb cast (headed by a simply wonderful Walker) really bring the film to life, adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcock\&#39;s breathtaking stylistics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers, but it\&#39;s still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems, considering it was released half a century ago. Once again, Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique, and the film\&#39;s surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-9/10&#39;
b&#39;I came across this movie on DVD purely by chance through a Blockbuster rental. Voyage to the Planets is an excellent BBC 2hour documentary/drama about a future &#34;grand tour&#34; of the solar system. Taking pains to adhere to current knowledge about the planets and space flight, and plausible extropolations from existing technology, this movie tells the story of astronauts on a journey to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects are excellent for a TV show. I found the actors believable as astronauts. The situations presented are for the most part plausible, and you learn a lot about the science of the planets and spaceflight! Only two minor complaints: I found some of the situations and dialogue somewhat maudlin at times. Furthermore I am unsure that a single crew and ship would be sent on a single mission to see all those destinations at once time. More than likely, visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. would/will be separate missions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn\&#39;t try to skimp on this show with production values. The scenes of Venus and Mars were actually filmed in the northern deserts of Chile--the driest area on earth and a dead-ringer for the Martian landscape. Weightlessness sequences were filmed in a diving Russian transport jet. The producers could have fudged on either of these using studios and CGI, but chose the real thing instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to especially mention the marvelous music that was composed for this movie. Don Davis\&#39;s thrilling theme is the first thing that grabs you when the movie starts, as the magnificent shot of the Pegasus passes the screen and David Suchet intones &#34;it is the destiny of man to explore the stars...&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching this on a small television screen is one regret I have. What a thrill to see this in a movie theatre, or even better an IMAX presentation!&#39;
b&#34;THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some movies that I could watch all my life and never grow tired of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was a 1987 attempt to bring the old favorites back to the forefront of animation, this time on the big screen. In an age when Disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office, THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE stands as one of the best animated films that Disney didn&#39;t produce in the 80&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is simple and elementary, having Alvin, Simon &amp; Theodore compete in an around-the-world race with the Chipettes (Janette, Eleanor, &amp; Brittany). However, as the chipmunks encounter exotic dangers, they are unaware that they are the pawns in a major diamond heist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE never was and never will be a film that soars thanks to an engrossing plot. And to people who didn&#39;t love it as a child, the film will probably never be more then an enjoyable, yet forgettable, animated movie. But for me, it will always be a little known masterpiece. Something about the film just clicks for me in a way few films do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every song is fun, upbeat, and harmless. Highlights include the Chipettes in a slightly risqu\xc3\xa9 Arabian dance to calm snakes. There&#39;s also a very sweet song in which the Chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major landmarks throughout the globe. One thing about the Chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying vocals, the songwriters always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating. This film is no exception... it actually boasts one of the best Animated movie soundtracks of the 80&#39;s if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every joke is cute, sincere and amusing. The bits between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very amusing. And the shock of seeing the Chipettes nearly forced into marriage by a child emperor is as well. The comedy manages to constantly play to the kids so that they don&#39;t miss anything, but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s really just a fun trip that is completely humble in it&#39;s ambitions. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE never aims to be anything more then it is, harmless fun. I&#39;ll be the first to admit this is a biased review because I have such a nostalgic fondness for THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE that I would never be able to give it a bad review... but nonetheless, it fills me with such a childish contentment while watching it. Everyone has their random favorite from childhood that no one knows, and for me it&#39;s this movie. And any film that I can watch over and over whether I am 5, 12, 23 or older is a great film in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... A- ...&#34;
b&#39;It has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better &#34;bargain bin&#34; movies out there - I\&#39;d feel a bit cheated if I had paid \xc2\xa315 for it, but at about \xc2\xa31.50 I felt that I definitely got more than my monies worth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film can\&#39;t quite decide if it wants to be &#34;Mad Max&#34; or one of the Clint Eastwood &#34;man with no name&#34; spaghetti westerns, and as such is stacked with clich\xc3\xa9s from both. Even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in &#34;Mad Max&#34; is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That guy from &#34;Blade Runner&#34; also cops a good billing, although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favourite bit - for me the punch-up on top of the oil refinery - if you look closely you can see the &#34;post-apocalyptic&#34; rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get several lagers in, a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel.&#39;
b&#39;If you\&#39;ve ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilarious. From teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about air bags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian, this movie really captures bits and pieces of Ukraine that you would never know unless you went there. I spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking, &#34;Yep. That\&#39;s exactly right.&#34; It\&#39;s a lot of fun if you understand Russian too because the subtitles just don\&#39;t always do it justice. The actors are so believable and Elijah Wood does a great job playing a socially inept Jewish kid. My favorite character is definitely Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., the grandfather\&#39;s &#34;seeing eye dog&#34; who is really a psychopathic border collie. The characters are so eclectic and likable that you believe that they are real people.&#39;
b&#34;-only few can understand Leland&#39;s character, and to do that u most likely are inborn to see both sides of life,and to face this reality is very hard and can lead some few to bad acts(like Leland&#39;s character does)but for such sad and real reasons that his intentions were good,in the sense that the intention to save another from physical or mental(in this case)pain over long time. and it is really sad how mostly everyone in this movie makes mistakes in it, but the one character to make one through good intentions is killed by it. the lesson of this movie is for the unique person to see,realize,face and make right of the real life situation u see and to make right,or inspire one who can make right of a wrong situation. but before that...u have to see both sides of something and rationalize it for the sake of long peace,and tranquility of all human life.aka-Don&#39;t BE IGNORANT&#34;
b&#34;Disney&#39;s Buena Vista Pictures presents a wonderfully told fact-based sports drama directed by actor Bill Paxton. Photography is superb, but story sometimes lumbers along. This film is about the 20 year old amateur golfer Francis Ouimet(Shia LaBeouf)and his competition in the 1913 U.S. Open. What a story; a once-in-a-lifetime chance for a supposedly incapable young man to play along side the best golfers of the time, including British champions Harry Vardon(Stephen Dillane)and Ted Ray(Stephen Marcus). A storybook ending leaves a knot in the throat. The cast also includes: Peter Firth, Elias Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox, and possibly stealing the show is Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, Ouimet&#39;s caddy and best friend.&#34;
b&#39;I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual &#34;horror&#34; movie again. I had been disappointed with her in most everything since the &#34;Exorcist &#34;movies (Which i loved). What was up with all of those nasty &#34;B-movies&#34; she did? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Hassellhoff on the other hand, all i could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. David needs to stick to &#34;Knight Rider&#34; or &#34;Baywatch&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, this is an awesome movie. Even for the eighties, this was an awesome film. It has horror, action, and drama. It is a suspenseful, and I loved the way Linda Blair turned out.&#39;
b&#34;i have been watching this movie repeatedly, since it came out. even though it is 8 years old now, it still cracks me up. the jokes are still hilarious and the way the characters are portrayed will make anybody of any age laugh like they&#39;ve never laughed before. Enjoy it&#34;
b&#34;Extremely good cinematic story of gay, embittered former teen star, now waiting tables. The sexual ambiguities are explored here realistically, and with an actual human face. This, and throw in a serial killer on the loose, and you have LOVE AND THE HUMAN REMAINS. A well portrayed drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. The screenplay is fluid and believable. The performances are well above average, and the twists in the story are sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This certainly isn&#39;t everyone&#39;s ideal notion of a movie, but for those who appreciate something different and slickly written, it&#39;s very much worthy of your time. Highly recommended.&#34;
b&#39;This one of those social dramas that WB knew how to put together and were guaranteed boxoffice hits in the thirties. This early &#34;dead end kids&#34; are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. Cagney, a gangster as part of a deal is appointed as the commissioner of the school. He doesn\&#39;t take it seriously at first but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys. The idea is to let the boys rule and administer their community. Whether this is sound social reform is beyond my belief but it\&#39;s a movie. It\&#39;s a lot like Boys Town with a slight darker tone. A useless happy ending deluges what impact the scene prior hard but is still good. WB would later make this same movies with Bogart in the Cagney/fatherly role.&#39;
b&#39;I saw this stage show when it was broadcast on PBS in 1983. I was involved in local theatre at the time and had seen some pretty incredible stuff out of the Dell Arte Players, but Bill Irwin floored me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was most impressed at how a man of his size (he\&#39;s quite tall and beefy) could fold himself up into a small box without so much as a pause for adjustment and move across the stage at a dead run without even a whisper of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most amazing for me, though, in this performance, was the way he rose to his feet during the jack-in-the-box / marionette piece. Those who saw this show will recall that when he climbed from the box and collapsed to the floor with his body limp and limbs akimbo, he &#34;pulled&#34; himself up by the top of his head as if by a string, and rose not just to his feet, but to a full ballet point\xc2\x97and did it in one fluid, seemingly effortless motion. Just consider the strength, grace, balance and focus such a series of movements must take in order to accomplish them the way he did! Add to his physical prowess his strong and believable characterization skills, and there lies a consummate actor / performer. My jaw dropped at the movement and my heart broke at the portrayal of a puppet who is determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the unfortunate (yes\xc2\x97&#34;tragic&#34; would be a better word) unavailability of this piece in home media form, I have noticed that much of PBS\&#39; works are not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes, PBS shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately following a broadcast, but they seldom stay on the market for long. There are exceptions, of course, but these are mainly the science and history documentaries; rarely does an arts piece remain in print for long\xc2\x97assuming it ever made it into VHS / DVD to begin with. I don\&#39;t know why this should be so; certainly, PBS could use the income from home media marketing of their shows, but they don\&#39;t take advantage of it much. This is a shame. There are many things I\&#39;ve watched on PBS that I wish to own, but pieces such as &#34;The Regard of Flight&#34; are, I\&#39;m afraid, a one-shot, once in a lifetime treat, never to be repeated on PBS again and never to be available for home media purchase. That really sucks. I\&#39;m lucky to have caught it when I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, yeah\xc2\x97our local library did get a copy of &#34;The Regard of Flight.&#34; And yes\xc2\x97it was stolen.&#39;
b&#39;Luis Bunuel\&#39;s &#34;Nazarin&#34; will always be remembered as a great film because it is absolutely honest in its presentation of comical assault on religion.It is one of those outstanding films which must be shown to all people especially young children in order to familiarize them with the notions of good and bad,sacred and evil.The toughest question asked by &#34;Nazarin&#34; is about the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion.It has been tackled by involving numerous ordinary people who are not at all above petty affairs in their mundane lives especially sins.Bunuel scores tremendously by showing us that various questions related to class differences deserve frank,honest and reliable answers. Nazarin appears credible as it has been made in a light,comical vein.This is the sole reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest appears absolutely true to life to all audiences.It is amazing how Bunuel approaches quest for true love issue in his film. This black &amp; white gem was shot marvelously by Gabriel Figueroa,one of Luis Bunuel\&#39;s favorite cameraman.Film critic Lalit Rao saw &#34;Nazarin&#34; at Trivandrum,India during 13th International Film Festival of Kerala 2009.&#34;Nazarin&#34; was introduced by eminent Indian cinema personality Mr.P.K.Nair as part of a special package called &#34;50 years ago&#34;.This is a film which should be with any discerning DVD collector.&#39;
b&#39;I watched Princess of the Nile for the first time when I was about 10 years old. I am 63 now and have never forgotten the movie. Nor have I gotten over my fascination with Egypt. I have searched the internet trying to buy the movie, but have not been able to locate it. It makes me wonder if this is one of the lost movies in Hollywood. I loved Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such charisma together. If you were to ask me anything about the movie I could not tell you anything other than who was in it. I vaguely remember a scene by the Nile with Debra Padget a bunch of other women.I have always wanted to see it again. I never thought of it as an escape movie back then, but I can see now where that was probably the case. I do hope they will put it on DVD and I will be able to see it again before I die. It was a wonderful movie.&#39;
b&#39;For anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch. However, it also leaves you wanting more. I loved the way that every character (detective)made an appearance. Least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie. My guess is Bayless of course. This like the series was a very well put together series of scenes. This is a series I wish had lived on. Thanks to the cast for some wonderful TV.&#39;
b&#34;I saw this film from 1918 recently at our local Helsinkian film archive. It seems that the Danish Film Institute has reconstructed it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Nordisk filmcompany, which was one of the largest in the world in the early 20th century. I believe there are several copies with English translations circulating around Europe at the moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the film fascinating and the trip to Mars well thought out. The plot line is certainly original, but I really don&#39;t want to reveal any more of it at the moment, as now the danger of spoiling things for you really exists ;-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is also available on DVD, query the Danish Film Institute (Det Danske Filminstitut) web pages at dfi.dk with &#39;Himmelskibet&#39; to get more info.&#34;
b&#39;Well I have to say I had the chance to see this show here in Philadelphia,PA sometime in June of 06.And I really loved it.my all time favorite Madonna look was the 1990 Blond Ambition tour era.this to me is &#34;MADONNA&#34;.now that she is a mother of 3 she has to change some things to suit motherhood.and I totally agree.this is a classic Madonna concert.I wish &#34;live to tell&#34; wasn\&#39;t edited.we saw body\&#39;s falling from buildings on 911,we can see a woman on a cross...any way I\&#39;m looking forward to the release of this tour on DVD and hope it is the entire show unedited and with a bunch of bonus footage.she is a artist of all time.the best out there...and still at the top and going strong.long live MADONNA !&#39;
b&#34;You know, people who make comedies so often forget it&#39;s really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it&#39;s perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn&#39;t that where great comedies come from? Don&#39;t characters need real feelings, real emotions, and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do in this movie. Unconditional Love is a movie you shouldn&#39;t miss, especially if you need a seriously good laugh, or you&#39;re at all curious about seeing the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat.&#34;
b&#34;The best British Comedy Film ever! For years English comedy television programs have turned into films and have flopped, &#39;Are You Being Served?&#39; &#39;Dads Army&#39;, the list goes on. However the popular dark humoured BBC television show; &#39;The League of Gentlemen&#39; has managed to not only create a film which has managed to not be a flop but has also managed to be the best British Comedy Film ever! With its dark and horrific twists and turns The League of Gentlemen&#39;s Apocalypse is British Talent at its best! Its intriguing demonic storyline written by the League of Gentlemen (Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson) matches with the Gents (and guest cameos) superb acting! This I hope is not the end of Royston Vasey, not after this great success anyway! Don&#39;t think that if you have not seen The League of Gentlemen on the telly that you will not understand whats going on. Its all well explained and by the end of the film you will be happy with the result but you are still left hungry for more... Mmmm, Special Stuff.&#34;
b&#39;Only Connery could bring that particular style with a line like that\xc2\x85 Fatima crashes into Bond\&#39;s arms when she water-skis up to the super agent in Nassau and apologizes, \&#39;Oh, how reckless of me. I made you all wet.\&#39; The super agent replies, \&#39;Yes, but my martini is still dry.\&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Carrera makes a great villain, stealing the show as SPECTRE executioner Fatima Blush\xc2\x85 Fatima is number 12 in the SPECTRE chain of command, and is a gorgeous assassin who takes intense sensations of pleasure in killing\xc2\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatima assumes all the deadly characteristics of Fiona, proving to be one of Bond\&#39;s toughest adversaries\xc2\x85 She is a victim of her vanity\xc2\x85 She\&#39;s good at what she does, and wants the world to know it\xc2\x85 But her vanity is her downfall\xc2\x85 Using every possible approach to eliminate 007, Fatima is a wild and cunning woman who makes love to the man she is about to kill\xc2\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austrian actor Klaus-Mar\xc3\xada Brandauer (Largo) does not make a very formidable opponent for 007\xc2\x85 Referred to as number one in the SPECTRE chain of command, Largo resides in the Bahamas, and travels aboard his super yacht, the Flying Saucer\xc2\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Von Sydow becomes the fourth actor to appear as SPECTRE chief Ernst Stavro Blofeld, once more plotting to put the world at ransom\xc2\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim Basinger takes the part once owned by the lovely French actress Claudine Auger\xc2\x85 She is Domino, the mistress of Largo, who soon falls deeply in love with her rescuer\xc2\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black actor Bernie Casey becomes the sixth actor to play CIA agent Felix Leiter after Jack Lord, Cec Linder, Rik Van Nutter, Norman Burton, and David Hedison...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward Fox portrays the new, unsympathetic \&#39;M.\&#39; Pamela Salem is the third actress to play Miss Moneypenny.

b&#39;The Happiest Days of Your Life showcases some of Britain\&#39;s greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditionally farcical and upper-class-twit like fashion. Generally it is a whistle-stop tour of stuffy English behaviour with the girls-only school providing a great setting for the dotty goings-on. Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Sim and - most especially! - Joyce Grenfell are all fantastic, giving us a lot of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with. As the film moves on, things get sillier and sillier with the tour around the school for the parents being a suitably crackers high point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I will give special mention, again, to Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gossage. She is so extraordinarily innocent, silly, apologetic and ineffectual that she seems to steal the whole film. She provides the greatest laugh of the film when she flirts with a male teacher (&#34;Call me sausage!&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst some of the film is slow or dated, and not always very involving, it still maintains most of its sparkle and barely pauses for romance. Good for a silly, harmless giggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#39;
b&#39;Countless TV displays and the memorable appearances from 4 of today\&#39;s mega-stars(plus Hope Davis\&#39;s screen debut) keep Flatliners still in prudence. The plot is about a non-academic research of five medicine undergrads pursuing one\&#39;s crazy idea on discovering the secret of death, and learn what\&#39;s after death, then come back to life again. Yet the storyline hasn\&#39;t been designed as fascinating as the idea of the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are popular stereotypes to develop a regular teen-slasher script in Flatliners. There is Nelson who creates the idea of decoding death, pretty but introverted Rachel, David who cuts the Gordian knot on luckily not to be dismissed from the school, ladies\&#39; man Joe and finally the smart guy Randy(&#34;I did not come to medical school to murder my class mates no matter how deranged they might be&#34;). They join hands altogether in an experiment where Nelson\&#39;s heart will be stopped and rerythmed. Then they decide to continue this experiment in strict confidence at night times in the campus. Not long after Nelson\&#39;s experience everyone starts a race over having the wildest and the longest death experience, risking their lives one by one. Yet, soon they realize their daily life becomes affected from those experiences they had. The visits to the afterlife brings back their delinquent feelings from their childhood memories. Depolarizing their deep subconscious watchfulness, they begin having somatic delusions and visual hallucinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the point comes where the explanation of subconscious, director Joel Schumacher skips that every humankind has a subconscious personality which they are not aware of. This inner personality keeps one from altering into identity loss. If you lose or if you depolarize this subconscious personality you certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood memories. I wanted to add this as a movie mistake, which already has been mentioned via movie critics in the earlier 90s\&#39;. Obviously here in this movie Schumacher made the actors have it least affected. Then why do they hesitate continuing on the experiment after learning their lesson, as if death is designed indiscoverable by God? David had been introduced as an Atheist, now he turned out to believe in God when he recalled a flashback from his childhood. After witnessing this 180 degreed change in David, it\&#39;s clear to see that Schumacher\&#39;s film was so conservative and lily-livered; that\&#39;s ultimately why it\&#39;s never classified as a work of science fiction. Alas! It had a good potential. It even tried to tell the unconscious maturation from having a death experience, beginning to believe that death is so simply natural and it\&#39;s only a part of a human\&#39;s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than what\&#39;s in the movie, it was also memorable to recall what\&#39;s with the movie. Jan de Bont as the cinematographer, who had worked almost every time with Schumacher, creates an dreamy atmosphere like it\&#39;s being an Gothic horror movie. The blue color schemes all over the walls reflecting into the actors\&#39; faces deliver first class of lighting, that suits perfectly with the film. The close-up shots of the gargoyle statues in the campus buildings, Catholic frescoes in the walls, stop-motion cameras, and the dynamic camera speeds were all belong to Bont\&#39;s skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flatliners became a cult movie in time with its sociological pen-portrait of the X-generation juvenile especially via its futuristic editing style with storyboard connection sequences like being part of a video music clip so much aesthetically. Those were the times where fast-paced and multi-sequenced video music clips were on rise. This style was very rare to come across in those years after its pioneer Tony Scott\&#39;s &#34;The Hunger(1983)&#34;.&#39;
b&#39;Why did I vote 10/10 for this movie that is just completely off guts*? Quite simply because if you just let yourself find it funny, you can just laugh until you choke. Some people might find that it goes too far, it is certainly not for everyone, but whenever I\&#39;m down and just need something really really stupid to laugh at, chuck on Bottom or GHP and I can forget all of my troubles and be transported into a magical dark and weird world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&#34;completely off guts&#34; is an Australian expression, it has no literal translation.&#39;
b&#34;Everyone knows that Lindburgh succeeded in the first transatlantic flight. So how can there be any suspense or intrigue in this film? Well, there is. Don&#39;t ask me how, but there is. Partly due to the director&#39;s expert telling of the tale but mostly due to Jimmy Stewart&#39;s thoroughly engaging performance, we are drawn into the story as if it were unfolding for the first time right before our eyes. Despite the fact that half the movie is filmed in a cramped cockpit, it is as dynamic as any action flick out there. So if you are apprehensive about seeing this movie because you think you know the story already, give it a shot. I think you&#39;ll be impressed.&#34;
b&#34;This is the best thing Burt Reynolds ever did . . . . nice combination of suspense and humor, with an excellent supporting cast, this is a very well written and credible urban drama with a great sound track as well . . . makes you wonder why Reynolds doesn&#39;t direct more movies . . .&#34;
b&#39;Michael is probably too cutesy for most action movie fans and too Hollywood for the intellectual crowd but I found it both extremely funny and very touching, despite it being both cutesy and formulaic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When three skeptics are sent to investigate a man claiming to be an angel they end up escorting him on a grand tour of the mid-western country side only to find that it is each of their own hearts that need investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When taking this film apart, as with most films today, there isn\&#39;t a lot of new material but when taken as a whole it has a refreshingly original approach and is off-beat enough to entertain one all the way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not being a &#34;Family&#34; film it is suitable for all ages and a good film to share with the whole family or that special someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Michael&#34; isn\&#39;t a great film but it certainly is a good film, a touching film, and well worth seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KWC&#39;
b&#34;I loved this thing. The most wonderful thing about Pink Flamingos is that it strives desperately to be in horrible taste, but has really gained a cult following world wide. Says a lot about us (us being people) doesn&#39;t it. Pink Flamingos succeeds because Waters made the film he wanted to make. A film need not be disgusting to succeed, but it may be. When you watch this film, you see things that are disgusting, but are ultimately brilliant because they are freely displayed. What we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression. Everyone who ever cares to succeed as an artist, be it in film or any other media, should watch this film.&#34;
b&#39;i have now seen the whole of season one and can say i have not enjoyed a show of this standard in a long time it great to see a show like this in the pipeline and hope that there are many on the way the season final was the best bar none cant wait for season 2 as far as i am conserned things can only get better like how will milles continu to change will rick get his family back and how will they get off the church roof with acting of this level it is easy to see why the show is such a big hit with people as long as people as making shows like this i will keep watching i think its hard now to come up with an original idea as so many shows have coverd a large range of subjects so to see one as original as this is refreshing&#39;
b&#39;Rating-10 Classic Waters! One of his best and most shocking films! Divine is THE most filthy person ever! Mink Stole also delivers a superb performance!&#39;
b&#39;Michael Radford, the director of &#34;The Merchant of Venice&#34; makes a tremendous job in opening the play, as he makes it more accessible for everyone to have a great time at the movies watching this thorny account of a horrible time in history. The luscious production of the Shakespeare\&#39;s play is a feast for the eyes with its rich detail of the Venice of the XVI century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as imagined by William Shakespeare. Having seen the play a few times, we were not prepared about what to expect. Mr. Radford takes care of presenting the story with such detail so it can be easily understood by everyone. Also, he has used a version of English that makes more sense, rather than relying on the original text. In fact, the way Shylock speaks in the film, doesn\&#39;t shock at all, being he, a member of a minority that has been marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al Pacino tremendous portrayal of Shylock shows a man that is vulnerable, arrogant, revengeful, mean, and totally human, all at the same time. Mr. Pacino sheds light into the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technicality. His own daughter has left him and his whole world seems to be caving in on him. At the end of the film, we see a man that has been reduced to being the target of hatred and ridicule by everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynn Collins, as Portia is a happy discovery. Having seen her in lighter fare, she not only surprises, but she makes the best of her role and her time in front of the camera. She shows us she is a woman with a high intelligence, who comes to the help of her husband and his best friend, who risked his own well being in trying to help Bassanio get Portia\&#39;s hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, the man who seeks Shylock for a &#34;bridge loan&#34;. After all, he knows his ships will be returning with fortunes from abroad soon. Antonio gets much more than he bargained for in agreeing with Shylock to the terms of the loan. Antonio\&#39;s best laid plans go astray when he is suddenly unable to fulfill his obligations. Mr. Irons gives a subtle performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Fiennes, makes a good appearance as Bassanio. His good looks and his charm make an impression on Portia, who clearly sees a soul mate in this young Venetian as she knows he is the one for her. Also, in smaller roles, Kris Marshall, Zuleika Robinson, Charlie Cox, contribute to make the film an enjoyable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, it\&#39;s Mr. Radford\&#39;s triumph because of the vision he gives us of Venice and its citizens during a horrible time in the history of mankind.&#39;
b&#39;I really enjoyed this Minghella epic, thought not quite so much as &#34;The English Patient&#34; (a modern-day classic). The first 20 minutes or so feel awkward, but as Inman (Jude Law) embarks on the journey back to his love Ava (Nicole Kidman), the film picks up in leaps and bounds and it becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently it is fashionable to hate Kidman at the moment, but I don\&#39;t agree at all, and she does well here. I actually think that the romance between Inman and Ada is weakly developed in the script (they really don;t get much screen time together to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman give it their all and convince. Ada\&#39;s journey is the crux of the film- she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything. Zellweger at first seems all wrong as Ruby, but she grows on you after all and sparkles in many of her later scenes. The film has beautiful photography and set design, but never really captures the true feel of a period piece. Jack White, in particular, has long straggly hair and a pale rocker\&#39;s complexion that look completely out of place with the setting. Cillian Murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented Irish actor in an early bit part, and Natalie Portman actually proves she can act in probably the film\&#39;s most striking sequence. It\&#39;s a pity that in &#34;The Other Boleyn Girl&#34; she\&#39;s so inadequate.&#39;
b&#39;I had completely forgotten about &#34;Midnight Madness&#34; until just now when I found it while surfing the IMDB. Now, it\&#39;s all coming back to me....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was one of Naughton\&#39;s first movies (as well as Fox\&#39;s) and sharp-eyed connoisseurs will also pick out Kaplan (Henry from TV\&#39;s &#34;Alice&#34;), Fiedler (he does the voice of Piglet in the &#34;Winnie the Pooh&#34; cartoons) and Blocker (son of Dan &#34;Hoss&#34; Blocker from TV\&#39;s &#34;Bonanza&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the two that stand out in my mind are Furst (from &#34;Animal House&#34;) and the superdude himself - Eddie Deezen. Furst plays a baddie this time out and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad, &#34;Why can\&#39;t you just accept me for who I am?&#34; His dad looks over his obese, slovenly frame and gives a simple, one-word response - &#34;Yuck!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Deezen... well, he\&#39;s a show in himself. As a latter-day Jerry Lewis he stumbles around, wades through mini-golf ponds, puts melon halves on his ears and ends up having Maggie Roswell fall for him. My hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the film, it\&#39;s typical early-\&#39;80s stupidity with college kids staying up after curfew and going on a city-wide scavenger hunt to prove which division of students is the best on campus: the jocks, the nerds, the rich kids, the feminists or the group made up of a little of each. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who wins? Who cares, you\&#39;ll have a lot of fun watching Disney Pictures\&#39; first foray into PG territory before creating Touchstone Pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven stars. Catch &#34;Midnight Madness&#34; any way you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long live Leon!&#39;
b&#39;When going to see Rendition, I was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with big-name actors. I was not expecting a film that was so engrossing, exciting, poetic, and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and didn\&#39;t let me go, even after I left the theater. A word of advice to anyone who hasn\&#39;t seen it yet, don\&#39;t let your politics come in the way of enjoying (or not enjoying) this film. Take it for what it is. I saw this with my conservative Jewish family (I\&#39;m the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal college student) and I thought they would write it off as &#34;liberal propaganda&#34;. Instead, they said it was a great film with excellent performances (they like to fancy themselves film critics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its Oscar-affiliated actors, while leaving out the constantly underrated Sarsgaard as well as new talent like the truly excellent Metwally. The entire cast gave good performances, with some standing out much more than others; my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which didn\&#39;t allow for much screen time for each of the characters. In fact, I felt like the &#34;sub-plot&#34; with Fatima and Khalid was just as prominent on screen as Anwar\&#39;s part of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have. Streep is truly terrific, as a heartless senator, and as much as I don\&#39;t want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her. Gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of the Oscar nods for this movie, seems a bit unsure in his role at times. H\&#39;s trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he doesn\&#39;t know how he should feel. Sarsgaard gave an excellent performance; his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie. Metwally, again, was terrific, and I hope to see him in more mainstream films. It\&#39;s a shame that Gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him. Yigal Naor, as shown on IMDb, has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes. He, along with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach, all gave great performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of Fatima and Khalid was not given any credit in commercials, but it brings a sad humanity to the story. The narrative was interesting as I was trying to really connect the two story until it was plainly told to us at the end. I\&#39;ve read some comments on here that say the love story was useless, but I disagree. I think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general. Khalid was the real terrorist, but he was doing it to avenge his brother, and even though he is responsible for the attack, you see a humane side to him through the story with Fatima. Not that I think we should feel bad for actual terrorists, but I think the &#34;we are all people&#34; theme was definitely relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever your feelings on terrorism, politics, etc. leave it out of the theater. The bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear.&#39;
b&#39;Excellent movie in many aspects. Vicente Aranda has succeeded in depicting the time (1830) with meticulous care. The light, the places, the feeling, are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie. And along with it -in opposite to what happened to &#34;Mad Love&#34; (Juana la Loca), a rather episodic historical movie- all of this beautiful photography/ music/ clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the actors, Paz Vega as Carmen is outstanding: liar, seductive, agressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia is a little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for Carmen, but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie. I recommend it to everyone: the best spanish movie of the year.&#39;
b&#39;This is truly a documentary of love about a fascinating character, her outlook on life and her extended family. The filmmakers spent three years taping Sister Helen at her halfway house and managed to capture so much wonderful material that you can not help but feel you know Sister Helen and her &#34;boys.&#34; The house holds 21 recovering addicts each with a story almost as involving as Sister Helen\&#39;s. The ending scenes are particularly involving and emotional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sister Helen\&#39;s story of marriage, addiction and loss reveals a very complex character who\&#39;s tough love is at all times funny, touching and endearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is a amazing in the way it tells its story in wonderful slice of life sequences which develop into a story that is almost as clear as if each scene were scripted and acted by the best. The honesty (and obvious dishonesty) of the &#34;clients&#34; is very involving as you learn of their fears and watch their attempts to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will never forget Sister Helen, Robert, Moe or poor Ashish(spelling?).&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Boogie Nights&#34; is a masterpiece it tells a great story with flair an great direction from a very talented director. This film features a cast which turn in outstanding performances. Though the subject matter is very controversial but it is handled with great care by very talented people. This movie has an unexpected emotional impact also, you will remember it long after it is over.&#39;
b&#39;This is one of my all time favourites. All the actors do a great job. Comparing this movie to &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; does no justice to both movies. &#34;The Wind and the Lion&#34; levels a much lower budget with fantastic actors portraying heartwarming characters in a heartwarming atmosphere. Action and beautiful pictures are provided as well, which all together guarantees a favourite movie to me.&#39;
b&#34;It&#39;s quite revealing to see this today and appreciate how far we&#39;ve come along in what we expect from movies, and at the same time appreciate how many bedrock notions were established.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we have a full-fledged narrative talking film - the audio and the visuals are pushed to their period limits. The framing is limited to about belt-high and up -- no face close-ups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compositions are remarkable; there&#39;s an early over-the-shoulder cross cutting scene to showcase the dialogue; there&#39;s a treacherous descent into a canyon with some harrowing perspective angles; a sun-bleached skeleton lies in the dust as the wheels and legs march in the upper portion of the frame; the tension in the showdown between the hero and the bad guy is visually captured by filming above the long axis of a large tree that lies between them; and on and on - early visual treats abound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, it&#39;s unsettling to see the young Wayne carry a film, unencumbered by ego or mannerisms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to wonder if Walsh recognized the self-reference: the subject is the journey of a disparate group of pilgrims; those who appear on screen are a disparate group of stage actors, vaudeville comedians, shell game artists, and, probably, carny barkers and ten-in-one show veterans. They all journey together to blaze a trail for how movies would be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worth at least one viewing to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later movies.&#34;
b&#34;Lifeforce is certainly one of Tobe Hooper&#39;s best films. It has some great special effects and a lot of nudity, so it seems like a typical horror fan&#39;s dream. The film is quit creative though and I think that&#39;s because of the script from Dan O&#39;Bannon and Don Jakoby. Nice cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film.&#34;
b&#34;Once again, Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people. This time the traveling circus put a lion&#39;s cage right over the rabbit&#39;s hole. So Bug&#39;s has to come out of the hole and face Nero (that&#39;s the name of the lion), which he does in his usual hilarious style. After a slow and rocky beginning to the cart, it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious. Nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for Bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one, if still shorn of a classic. This animated short can be found on Disk 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: A-&#34;
b&#39;Michael Radford has done an excellent job bringing this difficult play to the screen. He has taken a play with a reputation for anti-semitism, and shown us that Shakespeare knew quite well the humanity of the Jews. Radford said after the screening, and I agree, that Shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be undone by a driving, compulsive need for revenge. He also points out, quite rightly, that a man who was anti-semitic could not have written Shylock\&#39;s speech of &#34;If you prick me, do i not bleed?&#34; Radford is himself of Jewish descent and he has picked out the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty. no character is free from flaws; no character is evil. Radford has placed the play in the 16th century, which gives a lush background of Venetian politics and decadence on which to project Shakespeare\&#39;s words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get a chance to hear Radford speak about the film, I highly recommend you take it, since he gives details about life in 16th century Venice that illuminate a lot of the choices he made and give considerable extra depth to the viewing. I\&#39;m hoping that the DVD will come out with extensive commentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeremy Irons does a gorgeous portrayal of Antonio, a man who resigns himself to bearing the burden of his past misdeeds. Lynn Collins, a relative unknown, gives us an absolutely flawless, stunning, and detailed job as Portia. Not only is Ms. Collins beautiful - she also gives Portia layers of intelligence and humor prior to the trial scene i\&#39;ve rarely seen in any production of this play. the rest of the cast also does a terrific job, with a notable performance by Kris Marshall as Gratiano, and a beautifully subtle work by Allan Corduner as Tubal, playing the foil to Shylock. Finally, while Al Pacino pulls out his usual strong (and loud) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says no words, but you can see all the emotions and madnesses flowing into and out of him as he perceives his fortunes changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like period movies, I cannot recommend this movie enough.&#39;
b&#34;Read This:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOYZ &#39;N THE HOOD IS A SCENE-BY-SCENE, COMPLETE RIP-OFF OF THIS MOVIE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two friends in the hood, one&#39;s focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete. The friend who&#39;s an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed. (The athlete just happens to be Washington from &#39;Welcome Back, Kotter&#39;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me mad that people don&#39;t know this. It blows my mind everytime I go into a video store and Boyz &#39;n the Hood is in the &#39;Drama&#39; section while Cooley High is in &#39;Comedy&#39;. It&#39;s an embarrassing disgrace. This movie is both funnier and more dramatic than John Singleton&#39;s rip-off. At least Singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to Cooley High, but no, he never said a word. Boys 2 Men, however, named their hit record after this film.&#34;
b&#34;This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it&#39;s not difficult to see why. (A few spoilers - but for the ending, you&#39;ll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army. Boris leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him. Boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family. Mark, Boris&#39; cousin, rapes Veronika who feels obligated to marry him. Degraded and demeaned by the cowardly Mark, Veronika clings to the hope that someday Boris will return. Superb camera-work and wonderful set pieces by director Kalatozov. (For anyone interested in film technique another movie by Kalatozov, I AM CUBA, has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana, rises two stories to a cigar factory, tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long, long avenue - all without a cut.) Superb acting, particularly by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris&#39; uncle) that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement. A devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by Samoilova. (This movie is frequently linked with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.)&#34;
b&#34;Yes, maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn&#39;t take anything away from the film&#39;s charm and wonder. It was shown as part of our town&#39;s youth film festival and was the organising committee&#39;s favourite. Which is not surprising. The subject matter - coming together in a race-torn, though post-apartheid South Africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational. Of course, as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings. I saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children. A film to watch, meditate, discuss and act upon.&#34;
b&#34;I didn&#39;t know what to expect from this. I always considered Bam Margera and the CKY crew a team of knuckle heads devoted to to doing stupid things for entertainment. I didn&#39;t know that they could act. But everyone who acted in this movie pulled off good performances. The hilarity of the &#39;aaaaagh!&#39; scene mixes in with Ryan Dunn&#39;s depression and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend perfectly. At times the movie some scenes seem pointless but at the same time they&#39;re funny. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh but this film may not appeal to those that prefer detailed story lines and a series of twists and turns.&#34;
b&#39;I write this after just seeing the latest episode broadcast in the UK, and to me it must be a tough job to keep up the standard. The last episode shown called &#34;Blink&#34; has elements of Gothic horror all to do with statues that aren\&#39;t quite what they seem. The Doctor and Martha don\&#39;t appear much, but that doesn\&#39;t detract from a well crafted episode. The general standard has built to a high level and the last three episodes, the two parter with &#34;The Family&#34; and the latest have to me been the best that the current team have ever done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s not just David Tennant holding it together, the whole supporting cast week in, week out are helping as well. For those awaiting series 3 abroad, the wait is is well worth it.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Hey, I didn\&#39;t order no cab!&#34; &#34;Yeah, well you got one...&#34; What can I say about Hack...what a man among men. He was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold. If you were able to (and fortunately for America\&#39;s TV viewers...one person per week was) penetrate the cold, hard surface of Hack\&#39;s exterior, you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice. The show was superb, I laughed, I cried, I smiled...all in the same episode. My arms would break out in goosebumps when our dear friend Hack would exit his cab in another dark alley...with nothing more than his fists...ready to avenge a wronged civilian. A smile would break out on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in a dark alley\&#39;s facial expressions when the Taxi of Justice\&#39;s headlights illuminated upon his face. Week after week I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to bask in the warmth glow of Hack\&#39;s brilliance. I have never seen a better show, and I mourned the loss of one of America\&#39;s greatest treasures when the show was canceled. In other Hack-related news, I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I are expecting Hack Koen to come into the world in about three weeks.&#39;
b&#39;John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr\&#39;s short story. The secret to this version\&#39;s success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the film heading in the right direction. Be it an horrific scene or a &#34;what is in the shadow&#34; sequence, the film to me is a perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is spot on for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress, and Carpenter\&#39;s score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming thru the film. The cast are superb, a solid assembly of actors led by Carpenter fave Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used give the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it\&#39;s the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn\&#39;t pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it, lets wait and see what happens indeed, 10/10.&#39;
b&#34;As over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually only very few deserve this title &#39;cause they&#39;re so predictable), King of Queens is a very original, unique and astoundingly funny alternation. It&#39;s about the daily life of a deliveryman and his wife who works as an attorney&#39;s assistant in Manhattan in Queens, NY. With them lives Carrie&#39;s father Arthur, a picture-book extrovert, who is played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller and who steals the show from all the others every time he appears. Other important people are their best friends Deacon and Kelly, a married couple, and their other friend Spence who&#39;s almost 30 and still lives with his mother. What makes this show so unique and funny is, above all, that every single character seems so real and Carrie&#39;s cynical, sarcastic attitude is the total opposite of Doug&#39;s good-natured, slightly dumb optimism.And Arthur&#39;s the one who makes it absolutely unpredictable with his strange ideas and habits. He often gets himself into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to drag him out of the mud. Even if in my opinion the quality of the show decreased a little within the last years it&#39;s still one of the best daily sitcoms ever made. It takes a little time to get into the characters and relate to them, but after that&#39;s done, you get some unstoppable laughs from it. Although I think I couldn&#39;t survive one day with Arthur in a closed room without beating the guts out of him, I really adore him in this show. Watch and have fun, I give it a 9 out of 10.&#34;
b&#39;In &#34;The Squire of Gothos&#34;, Kirk and his crew encounter a powerful super-being, who keeps the Captain, &#34;Bones&#34; and a few crewmembers captive for no apparent reason. I could be wrong, but I think this is the first Star Trek episode I ever saw and the program that made me hungry for more. It is not one of the best episodes, but the rock-solid premise of an alien being who putting the Enterprise\&#39;s crew in a corner, is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch. In a way, the super-humanoid anticipates one of Star Trek\&#39;s most famous characters, Next Generation\&#39;s enigmatic &#34;Q&#34;. This episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation: it is the first time Uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what an endearing character Uhuara can be when the story allows her. Too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure.&#39;
b&#34;There is not much of a plot to this movie. There is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for neglience. Not much more than that, but .... IT DOES NOT MATTER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life, and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if you&#39;re not cracking up laughing, you have a smile on your face. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthau plays Charley, whose wife recently passed away, and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital. He is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him. Then he meets Anne Atkinson (Glenda Jackson) who, at first, is a patient in the hospital (their first scene together is very funny) and then they meet up again on a television panel discussion show, where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley begins to like Anne, and vice-versa, except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life (her husband was a cheater) and they decide to give it a shot - two weeks of faithfulness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not give away anything else, but I want to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on screen. She is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic, middle-aged comedy, but her touch with comedy is very light and agreeable. She is matched every step of the way by Matthau, who is more charming than ever. He does not have to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Macho to get the girl, he just has to be himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art Carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor. The scene where the baseball team owner&#39;s ashes are buried at home plate is priceless. He also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard does not have much to do in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to Carney and Matthau; the role does not tax his considerable talents, but he had to have had a good time making this comedy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very much recommended...8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. FYI -- Matthau presented Jackson with her first Best Actress Oscar, and Jackson presented Best Actor to Art Carney for his role in &#39;Harry &amp; Tonto&#39;..&#34;
b&#39;Filmed less than a year after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the subject matter was fresh in the minds of the cast, the director and the audience. Most of the cast are actual soldiers and officers just back from the war. The Soviet army cooperated quite a bit during filming, which is odd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Afghan intervention was a bloody and pointless war in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed. This film shows the tension and the cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that convulsed a small nation torn by war and civil-war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no lack of powerful scenes. One of the first is footage of steel coffins being loaded onto a transport bound for the USSR. Solders go about their work while an officer calmly ticks off the destinations: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, The Baltic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An earlier comment describes the last scene with Maj. Bandura as illogical. It is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film: the only human relationship Bandura maintained was with the Afghan family which he accidentally kills in the assault. Having lost his only buffer against the senselessness of the war, Bandura turns his back on the boy(and his gun) in resignation to his fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly liked the last scene: a flock of MI-28s rising over the mountains as the voice of a pilot yells: &#34;Uhodim! Uhodim rebyata! (We\&#39;re leaving! Boys, we\&#39;re leaving!) in a tone of sincere relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afhanskii Izlom is an excellent film - brutally honest and as unholliwood as they come.&#39;
b&#39;when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked. I think that only made the movie more realistic. The cinematography was great and it only come to show the great abilities of director Lewis Gilbert&#39;
b&#39;This documentary is not only one of the best documentaries I\&#39;ve seen, but also one of the most moving and quietly beautiful movies I\&#39;ve seen period. It follows the lives of two Sudanese young men, Peter and Santino, as they try to make their way into the American culture. Peter and Santino are friends at first, but they gradually drift more and more apart, as Peter goes to Kansas City, and Santino stays in Houston (&#34;a land called Houston&#34;). Santino\&#39;s beauty is in his eyes. He takes people onto his back, he supports an apartment full of other Sudanese, paying the rent, doing everything for other people. He is a quiet sufferer. Peter looks out for himself, getting a high school education while playing basketball and making Christian friends. It seems that director Megan Mylan did not know what she was getting herself into with the beauty of this tale. Peter and Santino are amazing characters that move you. But the real strength in this movie lies in its commentary on American society. It is not judging. It shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world, and how difficult it can be to outside people. I suggest you find this film, and look at America through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grade: 10/10&#39;
b&#39;I originally saw this movie in a movie theater on Times Square in the late eighties. Who would have thought this film would spawn two sequels and have this cult following.Night of the Demons was like most other films that came out at the time.A group of horny teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated local and then are killed off one at a time in various gruesome ways.Come to think of it the formula still is used and still seems to work as evidenced by Saw II that I recently saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw Mimi Kinkade at a Fangoria convention about six years ago and she was so gentle hearted!I guess that makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon possessed woman in all these horror flicks.Anyway, I just this film again on VHS cassette and this movie still holds up.A little slow at the beginning as I remembered when I first saw it but then it quickly picks up pace. One of the eighties horror classics and worth a look!&#39;
b&#34;Once you can get over Nic Cage playing an Italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love, not war, you can get down to enjoying this beautiful-looking film. This could be used as an advert for tourism in the Mediterranean. John Hurt is great and Penelope Cruz isn&#39;t bad, as you might expect. Christian Bale&#39;s character is somewhat one-dimensional, which is a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main drawback of this film is the adaptation from the book - having been told subsequently the differences between the book and film plots, I feel cheated out of a much better and more convincing storyline.&#34;
b&#34;A great story, although one we are certainly familiar with. Meryl Streep proves that she is truly the best actress in film today. Very entertaining, and just what I expected. Don&#39;t go see this film unless you are prepared to be used and manipulated emotionally, but if you have that expectation, then you will enjoy the ride.....&#34;
b&#34;No bullets, no secret agents, a story that is entertaining, funny, and believable. Met some of the producers/actors in this film at the theater. They seemed as interesting in person as their characters on screen. You may not hear about this movie on TV with high-dollar ad spots, but it is definitely worth checking out. I have spent $8 for a movie ticket on a lot of other movies that weren&#39;t this entertaining. Looking forward to future projects by this production company.&#34;
b&#34;Matthau is a widowed hospital doctor enjoying his single status and the footloose and available nurses on the staff whilst colleague and friend Richard Benjamin looks on with amusement and amazement. Their boss is hard-of-hearing going on senile Chief of Staff Art Carney who is up for re-election to that post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthau is content playing the field without commitment until he meets single mother Glenda Jackson who insists upon being the only woman in his life while she is in his life. At the same time, he comes under pressure to respond to the amorous advances of a potential litigant in a malpractice suit, and to support the shambolic and incompetent Carney in his attempt to be re-elected Chief of Staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a superior old-fashioned romantic comedy graced by four Grade-A actors and an excellent supporting cast working with a first-rate dry, caustic and sarcastic script. Carney steals every scene he&#39;s in and, in the parlance of IMDb, has us rolling on the floor laughing out loud whenever he appears on screen. We are otherwise entertained by the on-off relationship of the two leads and various sub-plots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lacks the ambition to be a great film, but remains one of the best of its kind and watchable and re-watchable for its comedic value alone. Deserves more attention than it seems to have received and well worth the cost of the DVD or video cassette.&#34;
b&#34;When I first saw this film around 6 months ago, I considered it interesting, but little more. But it stuck with me. That interest grew and grew, and I wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual VHS quality rather than the film itself. I purchased the Criterion DVD box set, and it turns out that I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great film. It is rousing, and I&#39;m sure it succeeded in its main aim: propaganda against the Germans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the most common criticism against this film, and against Eisenstein, that it is merely propagandist and nothing else. It&#39;s untrue. He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived. By now, the world is far enough beyond Joseph Stalin to be able to watch Eisenstein&#39;s films as art.&#34;
b&#34;One of the great things about The Best Years of Our Lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post World War II era, the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on V-E or V-J day of 1945. The problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while we don&#39;t often learn from history, we can be thankful that for once the United States of America did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous World War. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing in The Best Years of Our Lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century. So many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell who you see here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three of those actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the USA could identify with. They all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them, Boone City, Iowa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War is a great leveler of class and distinction. Bank employee March, soda jerk Andrews, and high school football star Russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like Boone City. But they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March is the oldest, a man with two children and Hollywood&#39;s perfect wife Myrna Loy. He settles in the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes, getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him, tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love his scene where another returning veteran, a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. Watch March&#39;s expressions as he listens to the man&#39;s pitch for money. You can feel him read the man&#39;s soul. It&#39;s what got him his Second Best Actor Oscar for this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the Pacific. He got a special recognition Oscar for his performance. Because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the Supporting Actor category which he also won in. His performance, especially his scenes with Cathy O&#39;Donnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands, is beyond anything that could be described as acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three, a bombardier in the Army Air Corps. Of the group of them, maybe he should have stayed in. He also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. That uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him. The problem is that he&#39;s considerably less in her eyes as a civilian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Mayo is fooling around with Steve Cochran, Andrews has the great good fortune to have March&#39;s daughter Teresa Wright take an interest in him. They&#39;re the main story of the film, Andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran&#39;s problems were solved with GI Bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myrna Loy gets little recognition for The Best Years of Our Lives. My guess is that it&#39;s because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at MGM. Still as wife to March and mother to Wright she really is the glue that holds that family together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Best Years of Our Lives won for Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn, Best Director for William Wyler and a few others besides the two acting Oscars it got. It was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries. It&#39;s almost three hours in length, but never once will your interest wane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best tribute this film received came from Frank Capra who had a film of his own in the Oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories. In his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the Oscars that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the film Capra had hopes for was It&#39;s A Wonderful Life. The Beat Years of Our Lives can&#39;t get better praise than that.&#34;
b&#34;David Cronenberg&#39;s `eXistenZ&#39; is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolismic one. In this context the technology is able to be part of human body. After playing the virtual reality game of `eXistenZ&#39;, the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior change in order to apply violent game-urges even when the game is over. In eXistenZ, technology has evolved from machinery to biological organisms that plug directly into the human nervous system; an idea that reflects Marshall McLuhan&#39;s belief who is a well known media theorist, that computers are extensions of human consciousness. Like telephone is an extention of the ear, television is an extention of the eye, telegram is an extention of the central nervous system high-tech virtual reality is an extention of human consciousness. In eXistenZ, technology is biological and thus more human than it is in our world. But as technology becomes organic, humans become more mechanical and therefore less free, unable to resist their game-urges. eXistenZ is a virtual realty simulation of man&#39;s existence. Jean Baudrillard describes a mediated society in his book of Simulacra and Simulation, which all power to act has been transformed to appear. The world has passed into a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ it is obvious to see Baudrillard&#39;s mediated society with the themes of the invasion of the body, the loss of control and the transformation of the self into other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you are in the eXistenZ, consciousness slowly replaces with another identity, your role in the game, which is a reflection each individual&#39;s real life subconscious. While you gain the control of your hyperreal life step by step, the aura of your real life disappers. For Baudrillard, `.simulations or simulacra, have become hyperreal, more than real.&#39; Our hyperreality, like Cronenberg&#39;s world of computer simulation, `.now feels, and, for all intents and purposes is, more real than what we call the real world.&#39; (Baudrillard) The purpose of the game which can basically be called &#39;experience&#39; is quite metaphorical. Because you can not even know what is experience unless you experience it. As existentialists say that, life without an exact explanation is absurd, the game of eXistenZ is absurd too. Cronenberg, ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. For instance, in the game, the other roles just stand still unless you ask them a pre-programmed question. And when you put their aimless funny looking state of being into the representation of our lifes, the exposed absurdity really shocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question creates anguish over the people who play eXistenZ. They have no doubt about their existence, however they do not know the underlying reason of their existence. The essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Existentialists have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as other animals and plants do; each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature. In the formulation of the 20th-century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence. `Choice is therefore central to human existence, and it is inescapable; even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads.&#39; Perhaps I should mention, `eXistenZ&#39; deals with the concept of freedom of choice too. You achieve your final role in the game by taking right decisions. If you don&#39;t than the game becomes irrevelant and boring. So, you begin to interrogate the game, your existence rather than your essence. You suddenly become schzopfrenically alianated from the game and realize your position outside the game. Well as a last word, eXistenZ is a well designed reverse simulation of life thus existentialism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#34;This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who&#39;s sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there&#39;s dancing and some acting (we just don&#39;t see some of the acting). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the power to decide who does home. There&#39;s really no point to the sing-off. The person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway. Another things I&#39;d change is to see them actually act on the show. What&#39;s Broadway without the acting? The last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people sing at the end. The eliminated Danny always sings the same song and the eliminated Sandy always sings the same song as they exit. Since they sing it every week those songs eventually get annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit to not being a fan of the movie, Grease, but for some reason I am hooked. This show is very underrated. It has so many memorable performances and moments.&#34;
b&#39;A film of high intelligence and activity. As well as being a strong capsule of the time and persona that was the 60\&#39;s, the film is also TRULY a surprise in its forward-thinking themes and the unique presentation of the system of power in a group. William Greaves appoints himself to the authoritative role in the group. He asks his crew members to film and film and keep filming. First the two actors, then the crew filming the actors, then the entire set including bystanders, policemen, and finally a homeless man whose been living in bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greaves edits the film (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting arc and motivations. Don\&#39;t expect to be bored by this film. Each of crew make for engaging conversationalists and often times are voicing the thoughts that the observer has watching this film. Greaves does well at integrating the multiple camera takes using synchronized three-in-one pictures and other attention shifting methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the film will really only be effective if it\&#39;s what YOU\&#39;RE looking for: if you\&#39;re looking for some abstract arty film that feeds your own self-indulgent ego while never having a point, look elsewhere. If you\&#39;re looking for a film that will have you talking and thinking long afterward about the desire for honesty and sincerity in documented &#34;reality&#34; and the inevitable transparency that comes of it, then this is the perfect film.&#39;
b&#34;If we consider three films with a similar subject, which are this one, which was made in 1930, &#39;The Covered Wagon&#39;, made in 1923 and &#39;Wagon Master&#39; made in 1950, the distance between &#39;The Big Trail&#39; and &#39;The Covered Wagon&#39; is only 7 years whereas the distance between &#39;The Big Trail&#39; and &#39;Wagon Master&#39; is 20 years. This is amazing because it shows how much movies evolved in those 7 years, and how in the next 20 years the changes were slow to come. &#39;The Big Trail is technically close to &#39;Wagon Master&#39;, but ages apart from &#39;The Covered Wagon&#39;. The story is about the pioneers going from the Missouri to the west in Oregon. Tyrone Power Sr. is the man leading the caravan, he is a rough and mean guy. John Wayne is the good guy and the film makes too much of a point of his good looks, not giving him a chance to be the Wayne that we are used to. Marguerite Churchill is such a proud lady that you wonder why Wayne just does not forget her. Raoul Walsh was a master at showing caravans and cattle moving through the west, he directed &#39;The Tall Men&#39; in 1955, which has a lot in common with &#39;The Big Trail&#39;.&#34;
b&#39;I wouldn\&#39;t be so sure to accept the DNA tests as irrefutable evidence against Anna Anderson. First, read Peter Kurth\&#39;s book on which this film is based. Anna Anderson knew things that only the real Grand Duchess Anastasia could possibly have known (forensic evidence in Anna\&#39;s favor aside). Second, compare the pictures of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Anyone can see that they are one-and-the-same person. Third, visit Peter Kurth\&#39;s website (url below) where you can read detailed information about the DNA tests, as well as why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person (scroll down to the link, &#34;ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA&#34;). Even Schanzkowska\&#39;s relatives believed that their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I for one will always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson were indeed the same person; I will never be swayed to the contrary .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.peterkurth.com&#39;
b&#34;This movie literally had me rolling on the floor (well at least on the couch) laughing. I didn&#39;t think I would like it, but it came on cable TV one afternoon, and I watched the whole thing and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Since then, I&#39;ve also seen Black Sheep, which was pretty good, but not as non-stop-funny as Tommy Boy.&#34;
b&#39;This is a romantic comedy, so it\&#39;s really a fairy tale, but an unconventional one. Cinderella, rather than living in the ashes, lives in an overdecorated castle in the suburbs with a good looking husband who\&#39;s no prince. She does find her prince, but he\&#39;s not that handsome. Instead of a castle, at least initially, she gets a tiny walk-up in Manhattan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pfeifer, Stockwell and Ruehl lead a cast of fully realized, if a little over-the-top, characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demme reaches the highest level of movie-making in my mind. He creates a world I want to move into - a Manhattan neighborhood and street life teeming with life and community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish IMDb linked to reviewers\&#39; other comments. I\&#39;d like to know what other movies the people who panned this one hate. I am always looking for a lot of laughs and for nice places in which to &#34;live&#34; at least for an hour or so.&#39;
b&#39;Even an old cynical DOCTOR WHO fan like myself can be left breathless by watching an episode of my favourite show . It happened previously during Eccleston\&#39;s finale and it happened watching this episode . It doesn\&#39;t happen often though but The Impossible Planet is an example of both the show and of television at its very , very best . This is stunning television &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience ( Many of who will be moving behind the sofa ) are instantly transfixed . A door opens and horrible monsters start stalking the time travellers . This might have taken up an entire 25 minute episode in the original show but all this takes place in he pre title sequence . You may miss the longer drawn out format of the original show but at least this new series is tightly plotted and if we\&#39;re treated to a disappointing story then at least it\&#39;s usually only for one week &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing to disappointment a viewer here . It is DOCTOR WHO at its most traditional best . Writer Matt Jones and director James Strong have gone out of their way to make a story that will be regarded for years to come . They do this by constructing a doom laden narrative . The Doctor and Rose lose the Tardis and they\&#39;re stuck with the protagonists in the far flung future . It\&#39;s interesting how many stories never feature this type of plot point where the Doctor and his companions no longer have access to the Tardis which makes for a more intriguing type of story . Without doubt the highlight is the scene where Scooti goes to look for Toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and beckons her outside . Everything from acting , make up and Murray Gold\&#39;s music makes this a scene that genuinely shocks its audience &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can imagine immediately after this episode the BBC switchboards received a tsunami of complaints for distressed parents saying how traumatised their children were . That it took them several hours to get them from behind the family sofa and that they\&#39;re now refusing to sleep with the lights out . To do this complaining would be to deny the magic of DOCTOR WHO . Yes it can terrify and yes such images will burn themselves in to the mind of a child , something they will never forget even if hey live to be a hundred . But I will bet my life that these same &#34; traumatised &#34; children would have spent the week begging that no matter what they\&#39;ll be allowed to watch the next episode&#39;
b&#39;The acrobatics mixed with haunting music, make one spectacular show. The costumes are vibrant and the performances will just boggle your mind! Simply amazing!&#39;
b&#39;I had heard about &#34;gaming&#34; and &#34;Dungeons and Dragons&#34; before, but I had know idea it could be like what I saw in the &#34;Gamers: Dorkness Rising.&#34; These guys are so funny and fun to watch. Especially the guy who plays the &#34;bard&#34; or &#34;minstrel&#34; or whatever, he has a gift for physical comedy and timing. There is so much background humor and energy in some of the scenes that make you really think that at least some of it was improvised there on set. The special effects needed to be worked on a bit, but I saw it at a convention last year and thats one of the things they said they were going to redo and make better, so it\&#39;s probably wicked now!&#39;
b&#34;Saw the movie last night w/o knowing anything about it (nothing else out seemed interesting and I had a Buffalo connection to this movie - UB grad). It was a very enjoyable movie. Liked the pace (it picks up after a slow beginning) and story. Well written plot and good character development and relationships. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes to see movies that have interesting stories. Found myself talking about this movie afterwards over a few beers - most discussions don&#39;t last more than a few minutes.&#34;
b&#39;...scratch it. Just as African\&#39;s created rhythms with the jawbone of an ass and Virgin Islanders welded oil drums into ear pleasing steel bands, so did urban DJ\&#39;s itch to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. &#34;Scratch&#34; is a wholly unnarrated documentary which will take you to the heart of the hip-hop/rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl, and the ultimate DJ/MC contempo entertainment expression. The film reveals some surprisingly intelligent and articulate &#34;Scratchers&#34; with startlingly unique abilities in concert and competition where the beat meets the street. Good stuff for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto gutter movements in sound art. (B)&#39;
b&#39;The cast for this production of Rigoletto is excellent. Edita Gruberova sings Gilda magnificently and passionately. Luciano Pavarotti also sings splendidly. Vergara is a fine Maddalena; Fedora Barbieri is a famous older singer who sings the maid, Giovanna. Weikl sings Marullo; Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. As Rigoletto, Wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this hard-to-beat ensemble of great singers. Kathleen Kuhlmann in the Contessa. All principals are well-known and world-renowned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an exciting Rigoletto visually as well as musically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have it on both laser disc and DVD. You should have it too!&#39;
b&#34;If you liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, the chances are you&#39;ll like this, too. Although I guess a few of the British in-jokes (like calling two London characters Dixon and Winterburn, after Arsenal soccer players) may be lost on some, this is still cracking entertainment, which veritably pumps with vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are all excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interplay between the two protagonists is always well-judged. In fact Scott&#39;s direction is very assured, considering that this is his first feature film, and proves that he has his father&#39;s talent for putting us at ease in unfamiliar surroundings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hell, I&#39;ve convinced myself. I&#39;m gonna see it again!&#34;
b&#34;This has to be one of the best movies we have seen and we highly recommend it for it&#39;s exposure of the injustices of bigotry. Billy Wirth is an incomparable actor and truly awesome as Corby/White Wolf. However, felt the story would have been enhanced if his character had more scenes. This is a movie that can be watched over and over without tiring.&#34;
b&#34;This movie may superficially appear to be flaky and for teenie-boppers. It seems to be the stereotypical high school movie. But in fact, it takes an honest and touching look at the high school experience. It doesn&#39;t propose some unrealistic ending where the geeks and the popular kids reconcile. It doesn&#39;t change what happened in adolescence; it just attempts to reckon with it. This is a really great, fun, heart-warming movie, good for teens and for those who can still remember being one...&#34;
b&#34;I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It&#39;s got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out! So if you watch this movie, make sure it&#39;s the original version.&#34;
b&#34;I can&#39;t say that this movie deserves a ten, because I would be lying. I adored this movie when I saw it, though! It carries the unique bond of a friendship between a teenager and a dolphin. Although it doesn&#39;t display the sweetness that Jesse and Willy had in Free Willy, it provides an exciting movie that the whole family will enjoy! If you love marine animals, or if u love just a perfect family film, this movie is suited for YOU! Flipper definitely shows us how adorable dolphins are, and they are playful and could easily be house pets if everyone had a big enough pool! I love whales and dolphins, so obviously this movie works for me. I do think that the producers should have chosen another shark instead of the hammerhead to enhance the antagonist part in the story. Perhaps a great white? FLIPPER IS MAGNIFICENT! So check it out!&#34;
b&#34;For a brief moment. The opening scene with Traci Lords and the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;techno bar is incredible. I&#39;d probably follow her to my ultimate death too! Best vampire movie of all time but with a twist. The fight scenes are awesome. Wesley Snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary. Great flick 9/10. Where&#39;s Blade II?&#34;
b&#34;Pink Flamingos: A Representation of Society&#39;s Past&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink Flamingos, a film directed by John Waters in 1972, is a very disturbing portrayal of the negative impact a traumatized childhood can have on future life. Babs Johnson grew up in a very non-typical home. Blatantly, you can see the impact this had on society through her actions up to the ending where she engulfs dog feces. Was this film just some sick and twisted perversion of endless gut-wrenching occurrences, or was it symbolic of something much deeper? To side with the first would be the easy way out and to the side with the latter might seem demented, but possibly true. The film does have some credible resemblance to actual events of our societal past. Every leader that we as people view as `horrible&#39; displays similar characteristics to those of Babs Johnson. Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolph Hitler, and Joseph Staling all had `troubling&#39; childhoods. Babs Johnson had a troubling childhood and therefore is associated in the same class as all of the previous mentioned rulers. That is why a great deal of her actions throughout the film can be seen as disturbing. However, were her actions her own fault or society&#39;s for letting her grow up the way she did. Furthermore, each character in this film represents either a past leader or event. Another coincidence is Edith&#39;s obsession with eggs. With an open mind this can be tied into the genocide and Hitler&#39;s attempt to annihilate the Jews. Some view Hitler as a genius, others a mad man. John Waters must have seen him as a mad man because his representation Edith was indeed mentally ill. Edith&#39;s son Crackers and traveling companion Cotton are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. Both names, are slang terms that represent a time period that most of us would rather forget. Theses characters are crucial in terms that it points out that in some times, our society in America was no better than what we often view as horrendous acts of social onslaught in other cultures. The chicken f**king scene is the epitome of what was wrong in our society in this time period and is still wrong. Chicken, is a 1970&#39;s slang term for woman. Therefore it might be possible that John Waters were trying to bring out the subject of rape through Cotton and Crackers actions. The antagonist family, if a single antagonist can be determined in this film, was the Marble&#39;s. Marble is often mentioned in association with wealth. Therefore this may be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the wealthy a fight that still continues on today and will probably continue on forever. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes but should also be noted for its camouflaged political agenda that Waters displayed so affluently throughout its entirety.&#34;
b&#39;I caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel recently. It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go. Two guys (one naive and one loud mouthed a**) take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky, make-shift tank/truck hybrid decides to play cat-and-mouse with them. Things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker. What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie, unlike so many others. The two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase/suspense scenes. Nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror/slasher buff. Definitely worth checking out.&#39;
b&#39;I particularly enjoyed Delly\&#39;s review of this film and agree that Howard is not the only &#34;damaged&#34; character. Howard is rather ruthlessly &#34;set-up&#34; by the script, but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or, if she is, that he murdered her. Howard doesn\&#39;t know and neither do we. In terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there, he bolts. However, he never actually harms Helen Gordon, no matter how enraged he is. Indeed, he reacts with horror at Helen\&#39;s fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissors...then he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered Helen with the almost pathetic &#34; I\&#39;m very tired now. I think I\&#39;ll go home&#34;. Frankly, I don\&#39;t think he\&#39;s a psychopath. A sick puppy, certainly, but not a psychopath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with Howard is that he has no real male identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental condition denies him a place in the army. He is singularly rootless and isolated: no wife, no girl, no home (again, at least as far as we know). And, he does a woman\&#39;s job - &#34;Floor\&#39;s are my speciality&#34;. Helen\&#39;s niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job. Also, although he finds himself strongly attracted to Helen, he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass. He is remarkably powerless - can\&#39;t fight, can\&#39;t work, can\&#39;t make love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen is justifiably terrified, however. She tries to connect to him but, finding that he doesn\&#39;t respond normally (i.e. way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose-tinted memories of husband Ned), unwittingly presses all Howard\&#39;s buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both characters, trapped in the house, trapped by fear, neuroses, rage and memory, deserve sympathy. I know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers, but I felt it fitted well, as it offered a kind of release to the characters. Helen is freed, I think, from the past. When Howard tries on her husband\&#39;s army coat, Helen\&#39;s disgusted reaction is highlighted. She no doubt feels that the &#34;sacredness&#34; of Ned\&#39;s possessions has been violated but, hopefully, her need to keep everything &#34;untouched&#34; has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger. Perhaps she can move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Howard is also freed - from his endless cycle of anger, hurt and violence. Whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable, but I hope it\&#39;s the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great performances from Ryan and Lupino. I prefer &#34;On Dangerous Ground&#34;, but this is pretty good too.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Christmas In Connecticut&#34; is a gem of a Christmas movie classic. While lesser known than some others -- it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time. I watch it every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Stanwyck is perfectly cast as, Elizabeth Lane, the single, career girl. Way before it was popular, Stanwyck embodies the single girl on the rise. Her NYC apartment, and her friendly &#34;uncle&#34; restaurateur around the corner typify the single girl in the city existence. She can\&#39;t cook yet she writes a homemaking column for a magazine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dennis Morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After being lost at sea, all he wants is to spend Christmas in a &#34;real&#34; home. Which sets up the delightful, madcap story that evolves. It is fun from beginning to end. We should all have an Uncle Felix too!&#39;
b&#34;Cliche romance drama movie with very simple plot but very good cinematography and script.The screenplay,directing and acting was also good.The flow of the movie is kind of manipulative in order to bring the audience to tears through the excellent love music and circumstance which works but later on after the movie,makes one feel raped in a way.Jones makes her character very memorable and lovable though.A deeper story could have reaaly taken this movie to a higher level but still,the movie delivers for it&#39;s genre.Only for hopeless romantics,big love story fans,big soap drama fans,50&#39;s Cinemascope cinematography fans and fans of the lead actors.....&#34;
b&#34;A wonderful story...so beautiful told..so intense so whit no keyboard to describe I think...,go see it feel it...,it tell&#39;s a story about love ,romance ,war,and be trail so wonderful so full of romance if you love romance see it ,if you don&#39;t love romance ,drama well skip it that&#39;s all I can I vote 10 out of 10 stars wonderful...&#34;
b&#39;Well, it\&#39;s safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is one weird film! Supposedly an insight into the human mind, Subconscious Cruelty is comprises four macabre and bizarre tales of the extreme. The first segment, entitled \&#39;Ovarian Eyeball\&#39; is really just a warm up, but it\&#39;s good in that it gives the viewer an idea of what to expect from the next three segments. It simply sees a naked woman laid out on a table, while another woman cuts into her abdomen and pulls out a human eyeball! I\&#39;ve got no idea what the point is, but it certainly makes for visceral viewing. The following story is the best of the bunch, and takes in the &#34;old favourite&#34; sick movie theme of incest. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He\&#39;s repulsed by her pregnancy - yet he wants to have sex with her anyway, and naturally he gets his way. This story stands out because of the monotonous and \&#39;matter of fact\&#39; narration, as well as the ending - which doesn\&#39;t fail to deliver the shocks. This segment is well acted, well filmed and easily the highlight of Subconscious Cruelty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, the next two sections aren\&#39;t as good as the second one; so the only way from there is down, but director Karim Hussain still manages to pull something out of the bag before the film ends. He doesn\&#39;t do it right away, however, as the third segment is the weakest of the film, and simply sees a lot of people have sex with the ground. It\&#39;s very surreal, and therefore memorable for that same reason; but there doesn\&#39;t seem to be a lot of point to it, and I was in the mood for something a bit more morbid after the second section. The film ends on a high, however, as while I\&#39;m not entirely sure what the point was - the final segment features the film\&#39;s best imagery. This segment focuses on religion, and certainly isn\&#39;t for anyone that values it! Director Karim Hussain has achieved something here - as while this collection of four \&#39;extreme\&#39; stories doesn\&#39;t come together as a complete whole, the film almost feels tasteful as it\&#39;s shot in such an eloquent and eye catching manner. The director would seem to have been imitating the highly respected surreal director Luis Bu\xc3\xb1uel, albeit with gore, rape and incest; and if you ask me, he hasn\&#39;t done a bad job at all. Not for everyone, but certainly worth a look for extreme fanatics!&#39;
b&#39;Sam Firstenberg\&#39;s &#34;Ninja 3:The Domination&#34; mixes martial arts with &#34;The Exorcist&#34; like horror.The horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable,but the film works as a mindless action/martial arts flick.The fight scenes are well-choreographed and exciting,and the film is never boring.So forget stupid dialogue,lame acting and annoying soundtrack-grab some beer and check this one out!Highly recommended!&#39;
b&#34;Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn&#39;t any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn&#39;t use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time. Its fun because they talk so fast you can&#39;t get everything the first time its nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes. Also they have so many references its amazing how smart it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you can relate to the characters also their so real and there actors are superb from the witty Lorelai to the hermit Luke to the immature Kirk the show is just amazing. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend sometime with there family this is definitely the show for them. There is only one word that can describe Gilmore Girls....CLASSIC!!!!!!&#34;
b&#34;After the atomic bomb hits Hiroshima, charred bodies lie all around, deformed victims attempt to communicate with relatives who can&#39;t even recognize them, and one person after another dies of radiation sickness. This black and white film, however sad and scary, is not without humor. The story revolves around a young woman Yasuko, who was hit by black rain after the explosion. She is trying to get married, but everyone keeps dying, and people are worried the same will happen to her. After finding a suitable mate (who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long), she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness. This film is a great portrayal of the atomic attacks on Japan, it will frighten you, and will perhaps make you cry. The acting is good, not overly dramatic like many other ww2 films that have been made.&#34;
b&#34;After all these years of solving crimes, you would&#39;ve expected criminals to know that they can&#39;t afford making mistakes with him, especially not with regards to talking much. This time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Columbo goes to college, and actually explains his entire technique, but for some reason the murderer still doesn&#39;t pay enough attention. However, this still creates wonderful scenes and delightful dialogues.&#34;
b&#34;I am a college student and I bought this movie at a used book store because it sounded really funny from the back description. Nothing would prepare me for what would be the FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is especially good to watch if you are an Atheist, like me. Because then you can see how silly these Christian people are. They seem to think non-believers like to live in really disgusting, messy houses and do nothing but drink beer and be mean to the neighbors. It&#39;s a LAUGH RIOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My buddies and I watch it every couple of weeks so that we may be entertained beyond our wildest imaginations! See this movie NOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s hope Rich Christiano makes some more of these movies to entertain us heathens!&#34;
b&#34;It was 1983 and I was 13. I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were working. After it ended I wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. Turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. We woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically. We began to worship the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I am not saying this is a great classic. Although it is for me personally. And I understand that the whole Valley Girl talk becomes annoying but that was the 80&#39;s. But deep down at the heart of the movie-it is a love story, and a familiar but good one. Girl meets boy and there are sparks from both sides, an instant connection. Julie&#39;s friends don&#39;t like him-he doesn&#39;t fit in, doesn&#39;t go to their school, doesn&#39;t have money. They like her better with her ex-boyfriend the football player even though he is a jerk. She makes the ultimate sacrifice-her own happiness for her friends&#39; happiness. And she has these really cool supportive hippie parents. It is one of Nicholas Cage&#39;s first movies and his first starring role. One minute he is absolutely hilarious and the next incredibly touching and romantic. His friend Fred is pretty funny too. If you were a teenager in the 80&#39;s you will love this movie or at the very least it will bring back memories. It is no longer my favorite movie but it is still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. I am eagerly awaiting it&#39;s release on DVD if they ever release it. You can go to Deborah Foreman&#39;s website to sign a petition to get it released on DVD and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie that are must haves if you like 80&#39;s music.&#34;
b&#39;I doubt if the real story of the development of Western Union would ever have gained a real audience. Instead of talking about the building of the telegraph system out west, it was the story of board rooms, dominated by one of the most interesting (and disliked) of the great &#34;Robber Barons&#34;: Jay Gould. Gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant - and part of his attempt at a national railway system to rival Vanderbilt\&#39;s. But this, while interesting, is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the telegraph lines themselves. At least, that is how audiences would see it. Jay Gould died in 1892. Had he lived into the modern era, and invested in Hollywood, he probably would have agreed to that assessment too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is endangered by Indians, spurred on by one Jack Slade (Barton MacLane). Slade, a desperado, is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a crimp in his abilities to evade the police in the territories. He is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the telegraph wires, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Creighton\&#39;s associate Richard Blake (Robert Young), and a quasi-lawman Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), who is Slade\&#39;s brother. Blake, an Easterner with little understanding of the West, is romancing Creighton\&#39;s sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings. But he does become a close friend of Shaw, especially in trying to confront Slade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slade was a real Western criminal, by the way, and the subject of a section of Mark Twain\&#39;s ROUGHING IT. He was hanged in the 1870s. But he did not have any involvement in stirring up Indians against railroads or telegraph companies. However, MacLane makes him a memorably evil, and totally vicious type. His killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind - and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance. But Lang is responsible for that, as well as other touches. Look at the sequence with Chill Wills, where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it. He spits tobacco juice several times while talking to Young, who gets a little splattered. Then there is an Indian attack which we watch from the ground level. At the conclusion, Young suddenly gets splattered again, but it\&#39;s not brown but red that covers him. He looks up at the pole\&#39;s top, and there is Wills with an Indian arrow through him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an exciting film to watch, and well worth catching.&#39;
b&#34;Now this is classic. A friend of mine told me about this flick, saying that it&#39;s incredibly lame, stupid, retarded, and moronic. He also said that I&#39;d love it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, I found it available from netflix and rented it at once. I&#39;m just shocked that I had never heard of it before. If I could give it an eleven, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#34;Watched Uzumaki last night and right away was reminded of two early Peter Weir films from Australia, The Last Wave and Picnic At Hanging Rock. They were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror. Uzumaki, to me, seems clearly influenced by these films. It has a number of fairly mundane scenes that become more portentous the deeper you are sucked in by the film. It also has more scenes of outright horror and although I don&#39;t think the film actually measures up to those two films it is well worth the time of most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair but I must say that years after seeing The Last Wave the film still stays with me, and it is precisely Picnic At Hanging Rock&#39;s unresolved ending that makes it so haunting. p.s. All the people criticizing the acting... pullleasse...in this genre?&#34;
b&#34;Closet Land. The title itself conjures up thoughts of secrets. And that is really what&#39;s at the heart of this Amnesty International film. Government secrets, personal secrets, both are integral pieces of this story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the greatest acting seen in too long a time, both Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe were phenomenal in their portrayal of a Government Interrogator and Victim respectively. With only the two actors in this unusual standard length film, it is instantly clear that both actors were dedicated and talented enough to pull the viewer into this tiny bubble of a world and shut the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A WORD OF CAUTION...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What isn&#39;t mentioned on the description of this movie is that there is a subplot that deals with childhood sexual abuse. While there is no graphic detail about the abuse, the nature of it may be difficult for some viewers to watch - especially given the intensity of the film on whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not a big fan of Amnesty International films, but this movie drew me in because the acting was so exceptional, and I can&#39;t help but make this movie one of my personal favorites.&#34;
b&#34;Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the 1997 comedy IN &amp; OUT. Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small town history teacher who excitedly sits down to watch the Academy Awards this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is a nominee. He is nominated for his performance in a film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech for inspiring him because Howard is gay. Now this floors Howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television. Howard is even engaged to be married (to Joan Cusack, in an Oscar-nominated performance)so he has no idea where Dillon;s Cameron Drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he has to defend himself to everyone at school but is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what Cameron said on the Oscars. Howard has a birthday party where he is given birthday presents like the soundtrack to YENTL and ends up explaining to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to make FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. He also gets a visit from an out of town reporter (Tom Selleck) who wants to do an article about him because he&#39;s gay too. The moment when Selleck plants a big kiss right on Kline&#39;s lips is a classic. But all of these little things have Howard actually questioning his sexuality and wondering if he really is gay...much to the aggravation and frustration of his fianc\xc3\xa9e, Cusack, who is beyond confused. The scene where she leaves a bar in her wedding gown and stands in the middle of street screaming about the lack of single straight men in the world is a classic. But what I like about this movie is the way Kline fully invests in the role and was not afraid to look foolish or look gay. There is a fabulous scene, probably the most famous from the film, where he buys a record, on how to be macho, and the guy on the record is talking about how real men don&#39;t dance and a disco tune comes on (I WILL SURVIVE if memory serves)and the narrator on the record says no matter what you do, don&#39;t dance, but Howard can&#39;t help himself and he ends up shaking his groove thing all over the room. It&#39;s hysterically funny and Kline plays it with sincerity and gusto. The film is not pro or anti gay...it&#39;s just a deft and amusing character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is. Wonderful film.&#34;
b&#34;I remember watching this series avidly and being so disappointed when it came to an end. Over the years since then, I have tried to find out if I could obtain a copy of it on either video or d.v.d., to no avail. However, I was delighted to find this website with details of it, only to be disappointed again at the point of purchase, that the videos available will not play on English recorders! This production was so wonderful, being absolutely accurate with Nevil Shute&#39;s novel, taking the storyline through after the end of the war, with Joe and Jean&#39;s subsequent life together - absolutely marvellous - and I just wish I were able to see it again, as since it&#39;s original screening, there have been no repeats of it on British television.&#34;
b&#39;Having recently seen Grindhouse, I was browsing in Video USA looking for some movies that might have played in real grindhouse theatres in downtown areas during the \&#39;70s. The Hong Kong action flick Five Fingers of Death seemed just such a picture. The cartoon-like sound effects and the quick jump cuts seemed a little distracting at first but after a while I was so involved in the story and the characters I didn\&#39;t care. Parts of the music score sounded like the &#34;Ironside&#34; TV theme song that was subsequently used in Quentin Tarantino\&#39;s Kill Bill movies. Some scenes involving the hero\&#39;s fianc\xc3\xa9 seemed to border on parody but they were so brief that they didn\&#39;t ruin the film. The most exciting parts involve the tournament and some revenge segments after that. Well worth seeing for kung fu fans!&#39;
b&#34;i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i&#39;ve already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i&#39;ve gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it. my vocabulary has widened from watching Gilmore Girls. Lauren graham and Alexis bled el are perfect for the parts of Lorelei and Rory. i think Luke and Lorelai should get married because Chris has left Lorelei and Rory way too many times. and has broken Lorelei&#39;s heart too many times too.&#34;
b&#39;One of my absolute favorite childhood films. The Chipmunk adventure packs incredible fun geared for young and old alike. The animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever put in an animated feature. Who could forget the dynamic &#34;Boys/Girls of Rock n\&#39; Roll&#34;, the exciting &#34;Diamond Dolls&#34;, and the heartrending &#34;My Mother&#34;? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighties. It\&#39;s too bad they don\&#39;t make them like this anymore. Most animated films today resort to violence, crude humor, or sentimental mush... except of course the folks from Pixar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: An amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages.&#39;
b&#34;I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment. I watched this not expecting too much from it. The Fact is that the cast were superb, Especially The lead Teen Female. The dark sides of them all came through, all were messed up in an not obvious way. There was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality. The serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children. What this movie is, is a strong drama/thriller. Yes I would agree they don&#39;t do the obvious, but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable. Also a decent dark ending, instead of which could have so easily been an opt out happy one. The attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also. I very good solid 7 out of 10. A little slow at times, but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from.&#34;
b&#34;Young, ambitious nurse Ms. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere. During the course of 3 days, she encounters strange happenings, even a patient in her bedroom watching her, yet she still stays. The mental patients are all a little eye rolling (espically by the Judge), but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The storyline is okay at best, and the acting is surprisingly alright, but after awhile it&#39;s gets to be a little much. But, still it&#39;s fun, quirky, strange, and original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The thing inside the basement is hardly horrifying, so the title is a little bananas.&#34;
b&#39;I won\&#39;t bore you with story and plot lines, as they have been presented many times already on this page, so\xc2\x85 It\&#39;s been along time coming since I have seen such a film. Beautiful, elegant and restrained, with a narrative pace to match. A film with sensitivity and understated qualities that is rare in these times of clich\xc3\xa9d plots. The beautifully subdued photography, saturated in rich luxurious colors, and for lack of better words, each frame is filled with an air of tension. The settings and locations are used repeatedly but the film manages to breath new life into them each time they featured, there always seems to be a key prop, light fixture, or set piece to slightly clue the audience as to where we are in the characters world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting reminds me of the &#34;The Bicycle Thief&#34;, not the style, but the fact that you forget that you are watching two actors engaged in their craft. There is meaning behind every gesture and almost every movement has assigned significance to explain the inside world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings, and situation of the two lovers. The dialogue is sparse but like the rest of the movie, is imbued with meaning. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is infectious. Used here it becomes a story telling device. And although the film is of Chinese origins, even a song sung in Spanish by Nat King Cole imparts the film with subtle meaning. The orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but the repetition is what makes it comfortable. It is used in conjunction with the story, and not just a means to put music to action, or to cue the audience to feel a certain way at a certain plot point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this film to anybody, I fear most people would be jaded by the calm flow of the story, but I would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic schlock that fills the multiplexes on our side of the world. I must say that I was completely taken by this film, and continued to watch it night after night. The story takes time to present itself and bears repeated viewings as very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. A very beautiful movie.&#39;
b&#39;I can\&#39;t get over the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. This is the first production I\&#39;ve ever seen of Sweeney Todd so I have no others to compare it to. But the impact is so strong, I just can\&#39;t imagine anything better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, there\&#39;s the music -- take &#34;Johanna&#34; (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing an interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs. It\&#39;s like a Bach chorale in that sense -- just a masterpiece of composition. And the underlying chord structure and voicings are so perfect -- a little bit of melancholy, a little bit of contentment, a little bit of yearning, all expressing these three singers\&#39; points of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then -- the lyrics. The rhymes are so clever. The rhyme schemes sometimes seem random but they always add up at the end. (The DVD, which I watched, has Closed Captions, and these are indispensable for appreciating the dialog and the lyrics.) Sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the performances. I can\&#39;t imagine anyone better than George Hearn. Why haven\&#39;t I heard of him before? His singing, alone, is masterful, but the range of his acting is simply amazing. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. The song about &#34;you and me down by the seaside&#34; -- who could do it any better? Her timing is flawless, pitch is perfect, every beat of the score is accounted for; and overlaying this achievement in musicianship is her utterly delightful comic delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a dark tale but I found it to be sweet at times; and the tune to &#34;Johanna&#34; continues to play in my head.&#39;
b&#34;In print this is one of the greatest short stories ever written, brought brilliantly and poetically to the screen by this father-son team, working together, sadly, for the first and last time.It is fitting that John Huston should end his career on a high note by bringing the work of one of his favorite author&#39;s to the screen, in what is easily the best Joyce screen adaptation. Huston made a career of adapting great works of literature to film, usually quite successfully. It is sad, and somewhat puzzling, that Tony Huston pretty much began and ended his career in film by adapting what would be his father&#39;s final project and picking up a well-deserved Oscar nomination in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once had the privilege of sitting in the company of the great screenwriter/playwright Horton Foote, who cited this film as one of his favorites in recent years (at the time it was still a fairly recent release). As a rather prolific screenwriter himself (and a brilliant screen adapter of his own works, as well as great authors such as Faulkner, Steinbeck and Harper Lee) he was obviously impressed with Tony Huston&#39;s first time effort, and possibly equally puzzled by his lack of output since then. If anyone has insights to share on the topic I&#39;d be interested to hear more.&#34;
b&#39;After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin) I was more than excited to watch his &#34;Masterpiece&#34; (O-Word Criterion) RIFIFI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now i am a little bit disappointed about the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have at least these five questions in my mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. In the final Countdown Louis Grutter shot from the inside a house the main Character Tony le St\xc3\xa9phanois. He couldn\&#39;t know if he is still alive or not, but he didn\&#39;t care about it and ran directly after it outside the house (with the money) to reach his car. So of course Tony wasn\&#39;t dead and shot him. BIG QUESTIONMARK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. In another important scene the specialist in safes Cesar gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring (which was a part of the robbery) a Woman which was working for Louis Grutter in a night bar. Stupid, because before this character wasn\&#39;t THAT stupid. And of course Louis knew directly that Tony planned the jewel robbery. SMALL QUESTIONMARK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.After the Gangsters behind Louis Grutter murder Mario Ferrati and his wife,Tony and his best friend Joe planned a revenge against Louis gang. At the same time they don\&#39;t care for the security of Joe\&#39;s wife and his five years old child. Of course Louis gang kidnapped the son. CHEAP and SIMPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The perfect heist: Of course this is the best 30min. long scene in the whole Plot, without any word spoken in the whole time, but was this a perfect heist?? Comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example Tony was taken a fire-extinguisher to banned the alarm. Also too SIMPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The Grutter gang went to the house of Mario, because they knew (however....) the jewels will be there. Then they murder Mario and his Wife. And then? They are not searching for it! NO. They ran directly out of the apartment. And more. They not observing the apartment after it so Tony can go after a while (which was the same day) inside to take the jewels. BIG QUESTIONMARK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all: it\&#39;s a good movie. Because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene. Because of the very good cut (The end scene in the car through Paris is stunning) . Because of a very good actor called Jean Servais. Because of this Black/White fever you will get while watching it. Because of some other reasons too other user wrote about, but please don\&#39;t tell me this is a stunning story.&#39;
b&#39;Samuel Fuller knows war, and is one of the only directors in American movie history who could accurately portray the horrific experiences of it in a form like the motion picture. His pessimism and idealism, if that sounds a little odd to mix together, work for him as a storyteller, and at the same time he\&#39;s always out to tell the truth, however brutal (or put into melodramatic constructs) it can get. Verboten, however, deals with the post-war experience, as we only get in the opening scenes the big boom of WAR- in bold for a point. The opening shot is like one big exclamation point that seems to continue on into the rest of the scenes: a dead soldier on the ground, the camera pans up, we see another soldier shot down in war-torn terrain. Simple, direct language. Then Fuller punctuates the intensity with something interesting: the title song played over the opening credits as both irony and sincerity, and then Beethoven music over a shoot-out between Americans and the Nazis. Sgt David Brent (James Best) is shot, the battle goes on, and then it transitions to him being treated for his wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might lead one to believe that this will be a somewhat conventional WW2 flick (somewhat in that one usually wouldn\&#39;t find Beethoven and, later on to an extent, Wagner put into these images), but this isn\&#39;t the case. Instead, Fuller makes this a \&#39;Coming Home\&#39; kind of movie, though not at all in the sense that \&#39;this soldier comes home injured and so on and so on\&#39;. Instead of really going home, Brent stays on in Germany, as he\&#39;s fallen head over heels for the woman, Helga (Susan Cummings, pretty good at pulling off the German accent), and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the military so he can marry her. What he doesn\&#39;t realize is that a) she wants him more for money so she can get food for herself and brother, however this gets complex emotionally at the point of revelation to the slightly naive but heartfelt Brent, and b) there\&#39;s an underground Hitler youth sect called the Werewolves, who want to pick right up off where Hitler ended- starting small, despite argument within the group- by attacking the very government that\&#39;s now embedded in Germany to give them, as Brent describes, a &#34;blood transfusion.&#34; With this, plus footage from the Nuremburg trials, and (as narrated, I think, by Fuller himself) a quick, no-punches-pulled history of the Nazi war crimes piece by piece, we get a multi-faceted look at a society in the dire straits of an immediate post-war environment. While Rossellini handled it his own way with Germany Year Zero, Fuller tackles it with layers: first there\&#39;s the love story, or what is the tragic downfall of a man who can\&#39;t see anything past what he thinks should be reasonable, that it\&#39;s his wife and a child on the way that he can\&#39;t leave, until the revelation that he\&#39;s (partly) been swindled. Baker and Cummings, along with Harold Daye as Helga\&#39;s young, confused brother, perform at with the utmost detail to emotions; these aren\&#39;t very easy B-movie parts, though they could\&#39;ve been that. Then another layer is the political one, the struggle of a society to come to grips with being conquered, and a mentality which is made sensationalized, to be sure, by Fuller, in respect to making the Nazi\&#39;s a total no-gray-area thing: they\&#39;re evil, particularly when they cancel out reason to meet their ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally there\&#39;s the layer of style, which is strangely absorbing. This is probably one of Fuller\&#39;s \&#39;talkiest\&#39; films, which isn\&#39;t a bad thing considering it\&#39;s one of his best written scripts, as the characters don\&#39;t talk simply or in too many platitudes (with the exception of a small scene where two characters talk about the Hitler youth as juvenile delinquents, which is actually, according to Fuller\&#39;s autobiography, probably another layer to consider in the subtext and the 50s period of movies). And Fuller shoots this almost in a real European style, when he\&#39;s not going for fight scenes or battles, as the editing isn\&#39;t always very fast, and sometimes a cut won\&#39;t happen for a full minute, or longer. There\&#39;s an odd tension that grows out of this, especially when there\&#39;s something said by a character that gets another one wild-eyed or suspicious; Fuller could easily go for a big close-up, but there\&#39;s a more sinister, cold quality to not moving away from two people in a conversation without a simple over-the-shoulder deal. But when it requires it, like the big brawl outside the American military office, or the Nuremburg footage spliced into Franz\&#39;s memories of the Werewolves, Fuller can be as stunning stylist as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to find, but extremely worth it if you\&#39;r either a fan of the director\&#39;s or of WW2 movies set in Germany- or even just a history-buff- Verboten! is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional one, with a cast that is better than expected from a B-movie, and an attitude towards the \&#39;other\&#39; that is equally damning and thought provoking.&#39;
b&#39;This film is well cast, often silly and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau work their tag team magic to perfection. Brent Spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director. From the first &#34;hare krishna&#34; to the last &#34;you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs&#34;, I thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy&#39;
b&#34;Yeah, I guess this movie is kinda dull compared to some of Pam Grier&#39;s other films. The plot is overly familiar, the dialog stilted, and some of the acting isn&#39;t too good. But it&#39;s worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film, where we see Ms Grier in a sexy blue wetsuit, with the zipper half unzipped. Yeah, it seems like a frivolous point when discussing an actress of Pam Grier&#39;s talent, but she also happens to be an extremely gorgeous woman, and back in the day, she had a body that wouldn&#39;t quit. It&#39;s nice to see it being showcased in a tight wetsuit. Rent the DVD, and then tell me I&#39;m wrong. Can&#39;t, can you? That&#39;s because you know I&#39;m right! :-) And yes, I really did give a 10 just for the wetsuit scenes! ;-)&#34;
b&#39;I wanted to love this movie. Everything seemed to be in place for an enjoyable, if not groundbreaking, film. It was set in southern France, good-looking and recognizable actors led the cast, and I really admired the vibrant African costumes, the proverbs and music. Despite all this, I didn\&#39;t love it. Movies are supposed to convey their meaning at the first viewing, but &#34;Secret Laughter&#34; doesn\&#39;t do that. Nimi and Matthew, as played by Long and Firth (both of whom have played romantic leads before and should have known better), radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish. I used \&#39;dried fish\&#39; deliberately, because it was one of a few - too few - strong lines and moments sprinkled throughout the film. Another winner was when Nimi catches Matthew snooping around her apartment. He finds a book of hers with her first name written on it and says: &#34;Your name is Nimi. I never knew.&#34; Then he insists that she call him by his Christian name. I watched this scene intently as Matthew asked Nimi over and over to &#34;say my name&#34;, realizing that up until that moment, they always called each other by their last names. I thought this was a turning point for the film, and expected that it get better. It didn\&#39;t. Why do Nimi and Matthew always seem to stand at ten paces, even in that &#34;say my name&#34; scene? What does Matthew like about Nimi, aside from her obvious beauty? And why would a sensible woman like Nimi fall for a comic book writer who regards his marriage as something he can put on hold when a beautiful exotic \&#39;adventure\&#39; comes along? And I\&#39;d like to add that it was a little hard for me to get behind a romance built on adultery. Yes, Jenny is a vicious harpy, but if I were in her shoes, but I\&#39;d probably match her Cruella tactics to stop my husband from straying. Believe it. The story hints at Nimi\&#39;s painful past, but never fully explores it. Some critics say Firth seemed a little awkward here, and I agree. For goodness sake, the actor summoned more palpable longing and passion as that early 19th-century snob Mr. Darcy (and while wearing those hideous britches)! As for Long, who did shine in \&#39;Love Jones\&#39;, there were times when she seemed to concentrate more on her accent than playing her character. Even so, there were many moments \xc2\x96 the \&#39;say my name\&#39; scene among them \xc2\x96 when she was in total control and came across really well. Yet, \&#39;Secret Laughter\&#39; is not without its redeeming qualities, and I\&#39;ve found that it grew on me with more viewings. Nene was well portrayed as supportive and well-meaning, even if she doesn\&#39;t fully understand Nimi\&#39;s attraction to Matthew. I absolutely loved it when Nene faced off with Mama Fola in those dueling proverbs scenes. My husband liked it, and usually he\&#39;s the first to sigh and throw insults at the screen if he doesn\&#39;t like what is going on. He even chuckled at the scene when Sammy asked Matthew some very frank questions about sex. So there you have it. \&#39;Secret Laughter\&#39; was good enough to entertain an avowed curmudgeon like my hubby, but an avid moviegoer like myself will need more than one viewing to appreciate what the director and writer were trying to convey.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Pharaoh\&#39;s Army&#34; defies formula. Instead of selling out for cliches and big stars, it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast, the strength of a well written script, and a fascinating and bitter story. The result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast, with a heavy emotional current. One of the best I\&#39;ve ever seen about the Civil War, and I think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film (if you like this film, try to see the similarly brilliant indie Civil War film &#34;Wicked Spring&#34; as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Pharaoh&#34; simply tells the true story of a small expedition/forage team of Union men who ride into a Confederate farm to take provisions, but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men. Tensions broil and relationships are made and broken. Nothing happens the way Hollywood would write it; this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history. Superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional, but often doesn\&#39;t feel like you\&#39;re watching a movie, more along the lines of hearing a story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film boasts an incredible performance from Chris Cooper who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role. He transforms, but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to. Patricia Clarkson is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in. She shares an interesting chemistry with Cooper\&#39;s character and where she\&#39;s the more severe of the characters, is still as easy to identify with. The rest of the cast is quite capable, and fill their roles in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The art design and the set are wonderful, and personally I love the cinematography. It all has the feel of a Civil War period photograph with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin-like metalic tint, but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting. They seem to have used natural lighting, but whatever they used works beautifully. Everything looks like it belongs where it is, it feels period, something I find rare in American period films. The actors act 19th century, not like 20th century people in old clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, this film is very personal. I think that as an indie it can afford it. The film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation, as bad as it is. It doesn\&#39;t fail in getting it\&#39;s point across, and it gets it\&#39;s point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films these days. It\&#39;s brave. It relies on it\&#39;s characters, a fantastic script, human emotion, and in the cold hard fact that the Civil War wasn\&#39;t all CGI, big stars, and hoop skirts.&#39;
b&#34;I absolutely love this show!!!!!!!, Its basically fox&#39;s improved version of the simpsons (cau&#39;se lets face it the simpsons are very dry if you&#39;re above the age of 9. It&#39;s political, irrational, and irresistible. Anyone who says they don&#39;t like it is lying, There is a character for every one. Peter, Stewie, &amp; Quagmire are my favorites. Peter because he is rude, obnoxious, and just doesn&#39;t give a crap. Stewie because of his amazing intelligence and how he hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it. And quagmire because one of guilty pleasures is dirty jokes. Also there is an episode for everybody too. If you&#39;re the political type there is Mr. Griffin goes to Washington (VOL.2 SEASON 3). If you like more of the sexual and bodily humor there is emission impossible (VOL.2 SEASON 3.). Or if you like any other kind of humor there is dammit Janet (VOL.1 SEASON2).Basicly what i&#39;m saying is that when you watch this show there is side splitting humor for everyone. GIGGITY GIGGITY GOOOOO!&#34;
b&#34;At first glance a film like Northfork, a town set to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent out to evacuate the remaining townspeople, could be just an ordinary film. As we soon meet a remaining priest taking care of a sick child, a greedy land owner, we could be set up for a simple story we could all easily digest. However, when one is first introduced to this film, you notice the amazing wide open cinematography and a scene involving a church hall missing a wall that opens up to the pastures and scenic view of the mountains with cattle grazing. It soon becomes clear that after this scene and a few of the towns peoples introduction, that this is no ordinary film and no ordinary story, it is something very special and unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance things are not as clear, but the cinematography and landscape that the viewer is witness to is stunning, and the characters that inhabit this small soon to be extinct area are just in word amazing. It&#39;s what can either draw you in closer to this qwerky film, or either have you bored sitting there waiting for something to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The films deep spiritual and dream like qualities, give it a slow and methodical approach which I am sure will bore some viewers, but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture, the film is great to witness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating 8 out of 10&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Footprints (on the Moon&#34;) is almost certainly the strangest, most convoluted and most atypical Giallo ever made. It may come as a restraint to some of the sub genre\&#39;s fans, but this film doesn\&#39;t feature many of the regular Giallo trademarks like bloody knife murders (preferably committed by a masked killer wearing black gloves), ravishing scantily dressed beauties and unpredictable red herrings. However, to compensate for all this \xc2\x96 and much more \xc2\x96 &#34;Footprints&#34; benefices from the most indescribably mysterious and non-stop compelling atmosphere I ever experienced in this type of film. The level of mystery in this movie is so high and unbearable it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared. Like the female protagonist Alice Cespi herself, you absolutely have no idea of what\&#39;s happening or why, and this feeling of utter powerlessness is unquestionably the film\&#39;s main strongpoint. As a viewer, you crave to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her, but you simply can\&#39;t. Alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her quiet and peaceful life gets brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize she has absolutely no recollection of the previous three days. She finds a torn apart photograph of a hotel located on the holiday island Gama and decides to go there in order to investigate what happened. On the island several people including a lonely little girl seem to recognize Alice, only she used the fake name Nicole, wore a red-haired wig and acted like she came to the island to hide from an unknown danger. Meanwhile, even the poor girl\&#39;s nights are restless as she has reoccurring dreams of astronauts hopping on the moon surface and an uncanny scientist called Dr. Blackman. The plot of &#34;Footprints&#34; is truly bizarre and slowly brooding, and particularly the cosmic sub plot is really difficult to link with the rest. Alice assumes they are just images from a Sci-Fi movie she saw long time ago, which sounds like a reasonable enough explanation, but you sense there\&#39;s a deeper meaning and actual connection to all the other events. Fans of tension-driven and stylish Italian cinema can\&#39;t afford themselves to miss this film, really. This is director\&#39;s Luigi Bazzoni\&#39;s psychological tour-de-force, with staggeringly beautiful photography and mind-altering music. In spite of the lack of violence (or maybe just because of it), the film is genuinely disturbing and the mental agony Alice goes through honestly affects the viewer emotionally as well. As it is sadly too often the case in Gialli-cinema, the climax suddenly comes rather abrupt and nearly doesn\&#39;t give a waterproof explanation of all the awkward events you just witnessed for the last hour and a half. Still, the content of &#34;Footprints&#34; will keep you contemplating long after the film has finished and its powerful impact will only increase. Florinda Bolkan is sublime as the tormented leading lady and receives excellent feedback from the limited supportive cast, including the young Nicoletta Elmi. The eminent Euro-cult star Klaus Kinski receives top-billing as well, but his role is merely an extended cameo. This film is actually a lot better than director Bazzoni\&#39;s more acclaimed (and much easier available) Giallo &#34;The Fifth Cord&#34;, so here\&#39;s to hoping &#34;Footprints&#34; will soon receive a fancy DVD-release as well.&#39;
b&#34;This movie gives you more of an idiea how Australians act. Even though The Castle is a great Australian movie, it&#39;s a bit out there. This movie is by far the best Aussie flick I have seen (haven&#39;t seen Dirty Deeds yet) and probably would be my favourite movie. The point is, if you haven&#39;t seen it, go see it. If a crime/action/comedy is your thing.&#34;
b&#34;I first saw this as a kid (THE LITTLE RASCALS first went on TV the year I was born) and fairly recently bought this on DVD. In between, I watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: Farina as a Nubian slave, doing voodoo, for example. I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if they&#39;d tried to do that now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice how the pie fights in The Three Stooges&#39; HALFWITS&#39; HOLIDAY and IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE resemble this one...and this film came out a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. There was obviously some inspiration from SS and Laurel &amp; Hardy&#39;s THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY for these films...remember, at that time, they all stole from the best, each other!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more note: Laurel &amp; Hardy buffs, that bake sale lady was none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared in TBOTC-the &#39;flapper&#39; getting into her car and getting it in the rear end. It always escapes me why she was never credited?&#34;
b&#39;&#34;The Honkers&#34; is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to &#34;The Honkers&#34;. I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw\&#39;s &#34;Junior Bonner&#34; was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too. The picture is worth watching, if just for the rodeo footage--some of the best ever filmed--shot by James Crabbe. The director and my co-writer, Steve Ianat, died a few weeks after the picture\&#39;s release, cutting short a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife Sally, his daughter, Gaby, and newborn son, Stefan. Please give this movie a shot. I\&#39;m betting that you\&#39;ll say it was well worth while. I thank anyone who has taken the time to read this. Stephen Lodge&#39;
b&#39;AristoCats is such a terrific Disney classic that I just loved so much as a kid. Still to this day I can\&#39;t resist watching it, it\&#39;s just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and lovely songs. I really miss the animation films like AristoCats, they had perfect voices not to mention the hand drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very witty and clever, the story was just so wonderful. This film is just beyond irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the appecio\&#39;s, lol, it was just so cute with the piano playing and painting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like they were her children. But when the lady feels it\&#39;s time to make her will, she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler. The butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abondons them in the middle of no where. Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of Thomas O\&#39;Malley, they head back home to their lady, but learn the coolness of being a skat cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that I feel is a bit over looked. I would always highly recommend this movie for kids or families, it could be enjoyed by anyone. The songs and story is just memorable. I will always join in for the movies best song &#34;Everybody wants to be a cat&#34;, such a great tune. I also love those dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned, they were just so cute. This is a terrific film, please watch it, you won\&#39;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10&#39;
b&#34;inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones&#39; own style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chiahweson&#39;s desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.&#34;
b&#34;The directing is brilliant, the casting is remarkable (though I would&#39;ve loved to have seen a little more of Aaron Lustig (from Y &amp; R fame), who played Paul Shaffer). I only have two minor quips about the film, as subtle as they are. One- Roebuck&#39;s Leno is excellent, but his stage presence (i.e. during what appears the taping of one of his late show episodes) is a tad underwhelming. Two- the distribution of the foul language. I am willing to tolerate foul language, so long as it is not used gratuitously, and to a degree, the film was gratuitous. The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of Bates&#39; otherwise well-portrayed Kushnick by her frequent use of it, and served to make Roebuck&#39;s Leno a goody-goody by his lack of use of it (of course, if the characters really did behave this way, kudos to everybody). Nonetheless, the piece is an excellent one, as far as television and video are concerned. The film, I feel, had potential for the big screen, but would&#39;ve required re-casting for the bit parts, and probably a different director, as well (the aesthetic feel is that of the Larry Sanders show, good for HBO, mediocre for cinematic purposes).&#34;
b&#34;I caught this movie right in my eye when I was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema. The tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it, I thought of the possibility of it being similar to National Lampoon&#39;s Dorm Daze. I liked that movie, aside from having a huge collection of such genres, I decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delightfully, I came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie. Amanda Bynes definitely kicked it off better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. Being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life, coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to. This movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time. The only way of pulling it off is through this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors. I&#39;d recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and don&#39;t worry, you will get laughs throughout the movie. It is a definite guarantee.&#34;
b&#39;I first saw this movie in the mid 80\&#39;s and thought it was a funny movie. As I have gotten older I watch this movie for different reasons. I like to view it when I\&#39;m feeling sad/nostalgic for my &#34;lost youth&#34;. I was a teenager (14) at the time of the release of this film so I can identify with many of the same problems/dilemmas that the campers/CIT\&#39;s in this movie have. I enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight canoe trip. The film is also full of funny one liners. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that was a teenager in the late 70\&#39;s to early 80\&#39;s.&#39;
b&#34;It was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch. The economy with which it has been edited and the films structure itself are the main elements that contribute to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film really captures the spirit of the revolution that it is dealing with - you really sympathise with the sailors and citizens. Of course, this film has it&#39;s own agenda, but as it is a practically redundant cause, it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tension created on the screen is excellent - starting with the battleship itself, and then moving onto the mainland. Things escalate believably and for a film of it&#39;s era, it really is quite unflinching in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is worth sitting through, (that is if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90mins).&#34;
b&#34;Returning from 20 years in China, a young missionary refuses to become THE CAT&#39;S-PAW for a gang of hometown hoodlums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was a bit of a departure from Harold Lloyd&#39;s previous movies. Comedy derived more from dialogue, often rather serious, predominates here, rather than the elaborate sight gags which powered Harold&#39;s classics of the past. There are some splendid moments, however, which are pure visual fun, as when Harold attempts to follow a convertible down a crowded street, or when he desperately tries to keep a nightclub stripper from losing her clothes. There is also the climactic scene, set in a Chinatown basement, in which Harold gleefully jumps unabashedly into the darkest comedy. But most of the humor derives from Harold&#39;s refusal to be the patsy of the criminals who&#39;ve run his hometown for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#39;s quite a collection of crooked politicians &amp; thugs Harold finds himself up against, played by a bevy of fine character actors: George Barbier, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Dinehart, Warren Hymer &amp; stuttering Fuzzy Knight. Pert Una Merkel is on hand as the tobacco stand girl who catches Harold&#39;s eye and keeps him intrigued by her no-nonsense outlook on life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie mavens will recognize Samuel S. Hinds as Harold&#39;s missionary father; Charles Sellon as an elderly Stockport clergyman; and Herman Bing as a German gangster--all uncredited. Also, showing up for only a few seconds as an attempted kidnapper, is Noah Young, a familiar face from Harold&#39;s silent films, here making his final appearance in a Lloyd picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fox gave the film fine production values, especially in the opening scenes set in China.&#34;
b&#34;The subject of children being terminally ill is difficult and saddening but &#39;The Cure&#39; successfully portrays the idea that it doesn&#39;t have to be all doom and gloom and, if anything, children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end. It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother, moving into a new area where their next-door neighbour is eleven-year-old Dexter, who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion. After his initial fears and ignorance over AIDS are allayed, Erik befriends Dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the Mississippi to where they have heard about a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talent from the two young leads of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, is exceptional. Brad was able to portray Erik&#39;s harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while Joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to Dexter&#39;s character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that his illness doesn&#39;t mean he still isn&#39;t a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old boy. The pair&#39;s interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well. Annabella Sciorra also delivers a touching performance as Dexter&#39;s mother Linda, who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to Erik and eventually becomes a surrogate mother-figure to the other boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set against an excellent soundtrack, &#39;The Cure&#39; is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with Dexter&#39;s AIDS status whereas the children, even the &#39;bullies&#39;, come to accept him as they would any other. What is also very touching is how, despite Erik&#39;s streetwise nature, he is the more naive one in his determination to cure Dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend&#39;s enthusiasm for a cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend &#39;The Cure&#39; for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting.&#34;
b&#34;A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a &#39;full ride&#39; scholarship if he plays well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE&#39;s Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre. Matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager, both over-confident and vulnerable, optimistic and cynical by turns. Influenced by Amy, Matt grows into a man of character and heart. He, in turn, forms friendships with his teammates, which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FULL RIDE has all the elements we love to see in a movie--great acting, admirable characters, exciting sports scenes, poignant drama, and a love story. Still, while one may have seen these elements in other films, FULL RIDE is assisted by performances that are sincere and occasionally, even moving. Perhaps what&#39;s most impressive about FULL RIDE is its sense of reality. Although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree, (clearly a disgruntled student who, for quite obvious reasons, received a poor grade in his film class) director Mark Hoeger grounds the film in a believable situation and location and does a great job of getting down to the grit of what life is like in a small town. These characters are real people rooted in realistic situations, which often create the most compelling entertainment. On one level it is a love story, on another it is a character study, and yet another it is a simple football film. All of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle.&#34;
b&#39;What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? You\&#39;d think so by some of the reviews. Al Adamson\&#39;s films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go into them knowing that already it helps, and they aren\&#39;t necessarily to be taken at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. First off, this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits, so you know things are looking promising. This is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body, the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital. Of course Nurse Sherri tends to his needs and all, and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her. And Nurse Sherri begins to change. No longer the nice nurse, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. There\&#39;s a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of Sherri\&#39;s co-workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo. This is not bad if you\&#39;re a cult film fan, but it may be bad if you\&#39;re a &#34;Spiderman&#34; fan because you won\&#39;t like it. At times this actually lurches towards &#34;respectability&#34; (for Adamson, anyway) but then it &#34;unredeems: itself with some ridiculous event. If you enjoy Adamson\&#39;s films and similar trash you may well like this, for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure, keep digging. 7 out of 10.&#39;

b&#34;Two things are changed from then.First of all i am not a kid anymore,and second most of new Seagal movies are just terrible.This is on my opinion the worst movie ever made with Derailed starred by Jean Claude Van Damme.There is no plot in this movie,the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which are painful to watch.I love action movies,but this is not an action movie....This isn&#39;t a movie...this is a group of irritating scenes which are connected in annoying way to kill the viewers love for the action movies.I am sorry but i don&#39;t have any respect for anyone who liked this movie.He has a serious intelligence problem then.I hope that Seagal will make some new good movies in the future.Good luck for him !&#34;
b&#34;I vaguely remember this film. I do remember it for the one solid reason that it is the only film that I have ever walked out on!! and since then I have never seen it available to rent ANYWHERE!! I can&#39;t spoil it for anyone cos I can barely remember it!! To think, looking at the cast, it seemed a winner, with John Landis directing, but good god, they must have been paid a whole lot for this drivel!! All I can seem to recall is that the dad goes missing and the family try to search for him, by trying to put an actual photograph into the disc drive of a computer. I walked out after about half an hour of this. I must confess though, I&#39;d love to see if I can get a copy, just to see if it really was that bad!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if this was on every actor&#39;s black list! I mean Christopher Lee was in this?? The legend of all bad guys, who&#39;d been in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings?? As I said - black listed movie, The Stupids!&#34;
b&#39;What a silly movie. While it looks nice, it doesn\&#39;t make a lot of sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana\&#39;s &#34;madness&#34; was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that is right out of the worst Victorian novel of the wronged woman, and that does seem a sort of mental problem, like Miss Havesham in a castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth had not been able to get past Essex\&#39;s sexual attraction.&#39;
b&#34;First off, this movie leaves you in a limbo mood wise. You don&#39;t know what to feel. So much so that you don&#39;t feel bad for Caines character when his son gets murdered (which was actually mostly due to bad editing). The script was too bland. None of the situations matter as you watch them. The soundtrack, or lack there of (if there was it wasn&#39;t good enough to even remember) does not help it one bit. Only good surprise to this movie was Andy Serkis&#39; performance. It was on par if not better than Caine&#39;s. The story would have probably gone better off if Serkis would have killed him. Because quite frankly you don&#39;t feel any kind of redemption in the climax. Just a feeling of lack of feeling, if ya feel me. Basically this movie massively lacks draw. Leaving the audience alienated throughout the entire thing.&#34;
b&#39;210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or so I hear) or the R-rated version released into theaters? Both are terribly awful, of course. Peter O\&#39;Toole and Malcolm McDowell have both claimed they wish they had never made this film (the latter of the two men reported this in an IMDb interview!), and I can see why. Nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half-hearted attempt at a plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much of anything here, other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the film: &#34;It was like one moment I\&#39;d be staring, admiring my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians going at it.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an awful movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/5 stars.&#39;
b&#39;In the European TV industry, movies like this one are called &#34;stickers&#34;. TV stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to, let\&#39;s say, Titanic, some not-really-blockbusters were a part of the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14 Hours is a story of a hospital, its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever. Unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low-budget film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newborn babies are very obviously not real, there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor-acting. The actors are not believable in their roles: their lines, when spoken, sound way too memorized, as if this was a read-out camera test.&#39;
b&#34;What a crappy movie! The main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in Canada, yet he had a thicker Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or does Uday look gay in this movie? Also, do all the chicks in Canada dress like sluts? At least that&#39;s how it is in this movie. All the females are dressed like strippers. Don&#39;t waste your time with this one! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. Wonder why Bollywood is going through a slump? It&#39;s because of movies like this. I miss the good old&#39; days when Hindi movies were actually entertaining!I couldn&#39;t even finish this movie because it was so bad. I think Bollywood needs to stop trying to replicate the style of Hollywood because it&#39;s just not working out. They need to stick to their roots because that&#39;s what makes Indian movies entertaining.&#34;
b&#34;Right on Colmyster. I totally concur with all your sentiments and add these. I came to my PC especially to post a comment on this dreadful (minus)Bgrade movie. I was going to say that in this day and age I am at a loss to comprehend how anyone could possibly make such a woeful movie - but you beat me to it. Anyone reading this and Colmyster&#39;s comment, trust me ---- DON&#39;t waste you time and money. It&#39;s an absolute shocker. The acting is totally pathetic, the script is way worse, and the (so called) special effects are a joke. Surely no-one actually invested money to make this movie? I really cannot think of anything else to say about this so called horror sci-fi product, but must pad this commentary to make 10 lines of comment in order to have it accepted for submission.&#34;
b&#39;...not to waste your time watching this vanity project. I\&#39;ve had my comment deleted twice now, for reasons that I have yet to understand, other than the suspicion that someone involved with &#34;Gone&#34; isn\&#39;t happy with what I had to say. So, I\&#39;ve pared things down to the nitty-gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone, nor unfair commentary: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;&#34;Gone&#34; is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words. Horrible, stilted dialogue, a script that just plain flails about like a fish out of water, acting that would embarrass the most self-centered of community theater divas, cinematography inspired by the &#34;Survivor&#34; school of swooping crane shots followed by static, nostril-exploring close-ups, terrible ADR work, special visual effects that aren\&#39;t, pedestrian music that totally fails to sustain any mood or emotion, terrible editing with utterly pointless freezes and fades, no art direction to speak of---the litany of badness just goes on and on...I felt genuinely cheated out of the time it took me to fast forward through most of it...time that could have been better spent staring at a wall...Under no circumstances should anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this subject themselves to this &#34;movie,&#34; because long before it\&#39;s over, they will be wishing they had been &#34;raptured&#34; before they made that mistake.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case closed. Amen.&#39;
b&#39;Love sublime says the title. Another blurb during the promotions of the film talked about inner vs external beauty. Well in this case the beauty - you decide inner or external - is provided by scantily clad (or is that scantily dressed/ undressed) Zeenat Aman who the director Raj Kapoor called &#34;a volcano of talent&#34; while the film was being made. One can\&#39;t accuse him of sarcasm of course - after all he was promoting his own film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper thin plot is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a - er - well proportioned body , a great voice (thanks to Lata Mangeshkar) with whom the hero Shashi Kapoor falls in love. He doesn\&#39;t want her face only her voice. The acting is desperate and even the 4 is because of the music with Lata Mangeshkar giving some good numbers. The rest is of course bunkum. Avoid - save your money. Inner beauty vs Outer beauty. !!! You need not be an Einstein to figure out which one the director was concentrating on&#39;
b&#39;No that its sick. It\&#39;s not sick. It made me want to puke because I spent 2 dollars on it. Its boring, Retarded, and annoying. I didn\&#39;t see the MST3K version, which sucks because I bet the MST3K version was funny. It\&#39;s sad that people waste money on these kinds of movies. I\&#39;m surprised its not on the &#34;100 Worst Movies of All Time List&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TromaDude\&#39;s Rating- 0 outta ***** stars&#39;
b&#34;If the following sounds tempting, then by all means rush down to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie post-haste:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Awful 60&#39;s hairstyles, from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The worst child actor in the world ever, who does nothing but cry and say DADDY in the most annoying voice imaginable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn&#39;t mesh with the film. At all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Stereotypical Indians who use blowpipes and talk gobbledegook. Oh, and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The exterior shots of 5, which look suspiciously like a toy jet on a string being led around a studio lit with blue light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Terrible special effects which make the ones used in the first Star Trek series look cutting edge by comparison. ( Special mention: The little boy&#39;s blond hair glowing. Oh dear..) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Laughable editing and continuity, where background items move between scenes, the soundtrack changes completely without any warning etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Not got enough money to hire a professional dancer? Get any lady from off the street to prance about like an idiot! No-one will notice the difference! Er..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. A &#39;thrilling&#39; climax involving quicksand, snakes (more stuff from the archives) and a ton of fake blood. Don&#39;t forget to put in a stupid &#39;tribal&#39; sounding song either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more sensible among you however, will wait for it&#39;s inevitable appearance on MST3K when this classic TV show is resurrected and then you can watch it in the spirit it was intended. Any other kind of enjoyment to be derived from this crap is unthinkable.. not to mention unworkable. So don&#39;t even try it. 0/10&#34;
b&#39;surely this film was hacked up by the studio? perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad, criminal indeed, writing and directing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the stylised acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhands, but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of tropes but only the offensive tripe of affectation. ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;finally not that scary, indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless horseman would suffice, no need for the myth about a german mercenary, although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing - seeing the horsemans head makes him seem far friendlier that a decapitated inhuman nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in burtons oevure. stilted and clipped as my parting shot...&#39;
b&#39;L\&#39;Humanit\xc3\xa9 is a murder mystery. These movies tend to be popular,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the 6.9 rating it currently has suggests that it has been, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few non-spoilers, for instance, include a 5-minute scene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wherein the main character eats an apple. And another 3 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where he breathes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you were wondering, this is not, in fact, art. Neither is it a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;commentary on humanity, which from the title it seems it is trying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to be. It is, in fact, boring. There are numerous attempts in this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;movie to say something about humanity. One might think to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;onesself, &#34;How would I comment on humanity?&#34; And the most&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;obvious and boring answers will of course be sex, love, and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that these options are uninteresting when done well - just that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are the canonical options. For sex, this movie does its best to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;make it unattractive and disgusting. In your first five minutes -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hence this is not a spoiler - you will see the bloodied vagina of a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;murdered 11-year-old girl; it\&#39;s a murder mystery, remember? Later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on, a few people throw themselves at each other and have what&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the director would like us to believe is &#34;raw&#34; sex, but in reality it\&#39;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;contrived and overly symbolic - but worse yet, uninterestingly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy being disturbed by movies. This movie showed me why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disturbing movies usually show something inside of someone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;their humanity, which they did not know existed and are a bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;scared of. L\&#39;Humanit\xc3\xa9 tried to do just this and failed, and I walked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;out of the theatre not disturbed, but disgusted, thinking that I had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wasted my time in the theater, despite having seen the movie for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;free.&#39;
b&#39;Now i like Johnny Vegas which is a good start, I also enjoy toilet humour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such as Young Ones and Bottom etc. This however failed to bring even a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;small smile to my face. The story follows Johnny around after his wife&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;chucks him out (how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as he attempts to shag anything that moves. Failing normally. I was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a waste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of my time altogether. Unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother..... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#39;A truly masterful piece of filmmaking. It managed to put me to sleep and to boggle my mind. So boring that it induces sleep and yet so ludicrous that it made me wonder how stuff like this gets made. Avoid at all costs. That is, unless you like taking invisible cranial punishment, in which case I highly recommend it.&#39;
b&#39;Not only Why? But &#34;What were they thinking?&#34; This must have been some&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sort of payback to Gus Van Sant, because this is one of those odd movies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that never should have been (re) made. It purports to be Hitchcocks film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;frame by frame, but without the magic or the tension or the great film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;making. Rent the original instead, spare yourself.&#39;
b&#39;Each year the company called Nu produces couple of &#34;action packed&#34;, &#34;full of suspense&#34; movies. This little nugget, called Shadowcaster III(Until I visited this site I wasn\&#39;t avare this is a whole trilogy), is a great example of the good job the company is doing. Frank Zagarino is as mean as always and does a great job as almost undestructable(?), schizophrenic(??) android. I won\&#39;t waste any more words since I don\&#39;t want to reveal the terrific plot and ruin you a couple of great laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating 2/10 (Revard for those hard working tehnicians. Man, putting together this kind of rubbish must be nervewracking.)&#39;
b&#39;It must be a long time ago that I have seen such a bad movie. I have to say it is really hard to make a good and/or realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money. Also I think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on Airbus. First, the cockpit look a lot like an Airbus cockpit, second you got a stick, third using computers to control rudders/elevators/aileron via &#34;fly by wire&#34;. When I saw this movie I thought like the intention of the film was &#34;don\&#39;t fly with computerized airplanes like Airbus, use Boeing instead they have a direct connection of steering and rudders.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say: Bad story, horrible acting (most of the actors), worst film trick ever...&#39;
b&#34;I&#39;m surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year old were bored. The chipmunks are cute...but the storyline is overly obvious. Not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance; but I wondered why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t admit to ever being a &#39;chipmunks&#39; fan, but I expected to be entertained. It&#39;s not even an &#39;escapist&#39; movie as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy handed view of &#39;success too young spoils&#39;. We&#39;ve seen more than enough of that with Britney Spears, et al, haven&#39;t we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t bother.&#34;
b&#39;OK, fans, it\&#39;s out on DVD. But the only reason to watch this is 1) to say you did (due to its notoriety), or 2) if you\&#39;re a hardcore Bill Paxton fan. I am not a hardcore BP fan but he was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning this off from sheer boredom. It\&#39;s a shame, because this could have been a good movie with some script work and if made by someone with some intelligence (and with a cast led by someone besides the totally miscast and talentless Judd Nelson). Sure it\&#39;s gross, but it\&#39;s BAD, and not in a good way. If after reading all the comments on how bizarrely revolting and dystopianly filthy this movie is you are still interested, do yourself a favor and see some GOOD bizarre revolting dystopian filth instead. Films by John Waters, David Lynch, Peter Jackson\&#39;s &#34;Braindead&#34;, Henenlotter\&#39;s &#34;Basket Case&#34;, etc., all come to mind. There\&#39;s lots better out there.&#39;
b&#39;Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies i\&#39;ve even seen. Obviously this isn\&#39;t intentional though. It takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff, and the other half spent diverting the lave flow through the city using fire trucks (yer right). It certainly made me laugh. The acting makes Arnie look like a RSC thespian. It is amazing that films like this get commissioned. A more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it, and would probably cost about \xc2\xa320 to make. ($40) I can see some guy pitching the film to a film company &#34;well there\&#39;s this big VOLCANO and it erupts in a CITY....pretty radical hey&#34; If you can find it in the dollar bins, maybe worth buying as after watching this most other films would look good.&#39;
b&#39;On the positive, I\&#39;ll say it\&#39;s pretty enough to be watchable. On the negative, it\&#39;s insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, whiny and pointless. And I\&#39;m not saying this to be mean, I really wanted to like this film, it seemed to have everything going for it, had the so called &#34;buzz&#34;, and was a hassle to track down besides. Had a little more effort gone into it on the story side, I believe this would\&#39;ve been amazing. And I expect the team behind it will produce wonderful work in the future, they clearly have the ability. But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Five Characters in Search of an Exit&#34; has to be one of the most boring &#34;Zones&#34; ever made. It was on Sci-Fi this morning, and, as usual, I changed the channel. I put it in my Top Five list of the worst &#34;Zones&#34; ever produced. Dull and predictable, and not worth watching. Serling worked this theme to death (earthlings in the hands of aliens, who often were giants), and in this particular version, it just doesn\&#39;t work. Anyone who hasn\&#39;t seen it before, will quickly figure it out. This is another Serling philosophical mood piece, perhaps paralleling the plight of those in prisoner of war or concentration camps, where the imprisoned may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their captors. William Windom, as the soldier who is the last to &#34;drop in&#34; is the only one curious to make the effort, and it doesn\&#39;t take long to figure the outcome.&#39;
b&#39;I like this movie and have watched my copy twice since acquiring it a few weeks ago. But you have to view it in the right context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven\&#39;t checked on the dates, but I bet this movie came out after and certainly around the same time as the Collier and Walt Disney popularisations of the vision of spaceflight being promoted by W.Von Braun. This is reflected in the attempt to seem factually correct and scientific. However, whilst certain ideas are put across ( step boosters, for example ) roughly correctly, other things are hilariously wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, we are told that a rocket ascends to an altitude and then turns ninety degrees to enter space...like reaching the top of a flight of stairs and turning onto the landing! Then we are told that by turning in the direction of the Earths rotation the total velocity of the ship is increased accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an hilarious misunderstanding of what really happens. Most space launch centres are located as near the equator as possible where the Earth and anything on its surface is rotating at roughly a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket departing to space, in an Eastward direction ( the same as the rotation of the planet ). Of course, if the ship turned to travel westwards once in space, its speed in relation to the surface of the Earth would be greater, but it would add nothing to the actual velocity of the vehicle. Decsribed in this movie as &#34;air speed&#34;! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, we are told that the travellers only feel free-fall, or &#34;weightlessness&#34; when they reach some thousands of miles from the Earth, outside of the planets gravitational field. Again, comically incorrect. Most crewed spacecraft travel no higher than a couple of hundred miles up, but as long as they ( and, their contents, including crew ) are travelling at an adequate velocity that their momentum in an outward direction balances the pull of gravity inwards, they will orbit in free-fall. Of course, travel far enough from Earth and even a slow object will coast outside the Earths gravity well, but in order to leave Earth orbit, outwards ( towards the Moon for example ) requires the attainment of &#34;escape velocity&#34;, around twenty one thousand miles per hour. So the vehicle will have already attained &#34;orbital velocity&#34; ( and &#34;weightlessness&#34; ) by definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the movie has vastly more hilarious stuff than this. Someone decided it would be more fun if they missed the moon due to a technical problem, fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find they had accidentally gone to Mars! The captain then ruminates to the effect that this must have been divine intervention! At which point, any pretence to being scientific is torn into little pieces like confetti and thrown upon the wind amid the merry dance of an increasingly barmy plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strength of a film like this in fact is in illustrating &#34;how far we\&#39;ve come&#34;. Not least in attitudes to women. The patronising drivel heaped upon the female crew-member is both hilarious and also shocking.To think that such attitudes were so recently &#34;normal&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said at the start, I find this film very entertaining, as a late night, lights out romp through the romance of travel in outer space, from the perspective of the days before it had actually happened. An antidote to the cold routine of spaceflight as it has now become in the Twenty First Century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won\&#39;t reveal the ending. It is both brave and shocking for a movie of this vintage and character.&#39;
b&#34;All the actors in this film seem bored. They are not really interested in their roles and the dialogue is all delivered in monotone. It&#39;s a problem because I think the basic idea for the film is really very sound. I suppose it&#39;s just bad direction which leaves the actors drifting.&#34;
b&#39;George Cukor\&#39;s The Women remains one of the glittering gems of 1939, Hollywood\&#39;s most golden of golden years. The film crackled and sparked and it\&#39;s absence of males was a subtle touch, hardly noticed because of all the fine entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York City, in front of Saks. Large crowds bustle along the Avenue...but something\&#39;s off. The shot reveals only well dressed (attractive and young) women. Creepier than I Am Legend, the visual concept continues, inside the store and later at a large fashion show. What NYC fashion show doesn\&#39;t have at least 5 gay men? The &#34;no men&#34; rule is rammed down our throats creating an alien world, off balance and distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Meg Ryan, first seen digging in her garden wearing a ridiculous get-up complete with her retro curls and flailing arms. I immediately sympathized with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere. Later in the film she morphs into an older Jennifer Aniston look and keeps her arms at her sides. This seems intentional as if to say &#34;Look! I can still be relevant!&#34; Ryan\&#39;s character is loaded down with a coven of miss-matched friends (insert Sex and the City comparison here) who, if it were real life, would despise each other. Annette Bening plays the power bitch, who during the course of the film realizes her life\&#39;s dream doesn\&#39;t really make her happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is the power lesbian, all atitudinous with no use for any of the men who aren\&#39;t there. Debra Messing is some sort of baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is an odd choice for the bad girl to say the least. She looks fake, acts fake and any humor she tries to demonstrate falls flat. Someone\&#39;s comment on here that she looked trans-gender was spot on. Other various stars show up, to rearrange the furniture on this Titanic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have named their price, tucked their tongues firmly into their cheeks and pulled off something very clever and profitable. But no, Hollywood thinks of itself way too highly for that kind of exploitation. Instead we\&#39;re given this thing that lumbers along awkwardly with no sparkle. Entire sections of dialog from the original are lifted and plopped down into a scene with awful results. At one point Ryan exclaims something along the lines of, &#34;This isn\&#39;t a 1930\&#39;s movie!&#34; No Meg, it\&#39;s not.&#39;
b&#39;First off, I refuse to even consider this piece of work a Music video... I consider it a short film that uses excerpts of the song &#34;Thriller&#34; in its soundtrack. To me a music video must be no longer than the song itself, and the song must play the entire length of the video. Calling this a music video is like calling The Great Gatsby a poem. On top of this... let\&#39;s face it... &#34;thriller&#34; is a boring 14 minutes, including the extremely dated werewolf transformation, the mindless Vincent Price poem (just because VP recites it doesn\&#39;t mean it\&#39;s not lame), and the least threatening zombies I have ever seen. Sure, this was certainly a cultural phenomenon, but don\&#39;t forget, this also happened at the same time the A-Team was the #1 show on TV, so lets not give the culture too much credit on that one... One last point on this film\&#39;s impact on the media on music videos... what exactly did this add to the equation that &#34;Billie Jean&#34; and &#34;Beat It&#34; didn\&#39;t already add? From what I can tell, it only added the practice of stopping the song for some dialog, or a superfluous dance scene... so you could say that all this video really did was give Puffy the inspiration to make more annoying music videos... Not quite my definition of great&#39;
b&#34;Your idol will deceive you in this movie. Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending under his father&#39;s orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years-old. This makes his relationship (a collection of copulation scenes, basically) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing. The character&#39;s have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe. Nichols, who is one of daytime TV&#39;s best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie: watching him have sex over and over with this girl. It&#39;s like watching two animals going at it. If you&#39;re a fan of this actor&#39;s talent in other projects, don&#39;t rent this for you will never view him in the same way. If, on the other hand, you want to see Stephen Nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera, you might like it: Stephen will show you his naked butt, lots of tongue work, his groaning range, but not his talent as this character who&#39;s obviously just as sex-driven and misjudging as he was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera. He may have found it kinky but I didn&#39;t - a BIG deception!&#34;
b&#39;***May contain spoilers***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had very high expectations for this film, based on the trailer. I knew a bit about the real Ed Gein, so I figured this was a medium-budget Hollywood version of the real events. Man was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the writing apparently came from an eight-grader who barely knew anything about Ed\&#39;s history and cranked out the script in about 20 minutes. The movie completely passes over the most interesting facets of Ed and his relationship with his mother (not to mention what the real police found in his house) and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy who looks like he just wandered onto the set. Likewise, all of the male characters seem to be ad-libbing their dialog throughout the entire movie. I\&#39;m not exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t even get me started with the historical goofs in this movie. Seriously, who the hell directed this? This movie is supposed to take place around 1957, but the cops are carrying modern side-handled batons, some of the stuff in the hardware store look like they came from Lowes, and when the cop gets to a payphone he dials 9-1-1 (didn\&#39;t exist back then). Also, Ed was a small guy, scary like Anthony Perkins\&#39; character in Psycho (who was supposedly based on real-life Ed), not this burly dude who ended up looking way too much like the bad guy in Men In Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that really bugged me was the appearance that the makers of this film shot the whole thing in an abandoned, 3 building set. Because of the &#34;clever&#34; camera angles, you never see any actual town, and the interior of the sets looked like old, long-abandoned shacks. Pop a cash register on a saw-horse and bam!--instant hardware store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m usually pretty forgiving of low-budget horror films, but this one just begs for it. All you had to do was include most of the real events (even embellish them!), pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones, and for Pete\&#39;s sake take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while. My advice: Google Ed Gein, you\&#39;ll be far more entertained.&#39;
b&#39;Hilarious!! I would have sworn Ed Wood wrote this. Terrible. I loved every frame. Bad movie aficionado\&#39;s, this is your trophy! I will watch it again. Words cannot explain how entertaining this movie is. Pare\&#39;s career must have dipped low, but I really think he\&#39;s heading in the Leslie Nielson direction. He was perfect for this. Terrible, just terrible!! You\&#39;ll love it!! Get some friends, lots of beer, and you\&#39;ll have the time of your life. It\&#39;s an MST3000 party, waiting to happen. Enjoy!! It is worth the rental!! You like the &#34;Colombo type&#34; cop and the comic relief coroner. The bad guy will have you on the floor laughing. He\&#39;s also in another Pare movie, Komodo vs Cobra, and he\&#39;s just as good there. I don\&#39;t know what the budget was but they\&#39;ll get it back because this film is destined to be the best unintended comedy of the year.&#39;
b&#34;The movie contains a very short scene of Deneuve in a bathtub. She looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56, but this is the only saving grace of the movie. Otherwise, it has a mindless, unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of Deneuve&#39;s appeal. The director apparently watched too many Peter Greenaway films and Pola X comes across as a student&#39;s imitation of the Greenaway style, without any of his inspiration.&#34;
b&#34;I suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential, but nothing more, because boy did the filmmakers botch it. The plot is practically incomprehensible, the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic. And what the hell is a trade rat? Worst of all, though, this movie&#39;s climax is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes; plus the title doesn&#39;t seem even remotely accurate. The only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty dark-haired woman... well, the blond girl was pretty too, but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette. Anyhoo, as with a lot of movies, this is one to be seen only on MST3K.&#34;
b&#34;Laughable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clich\xc3\xa9d.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overdoses on style to compensate for poor writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember when MTV actually used to air music videos and other shows besides Reality Shows? Aeon Flux (2005) is based upon one such show \xc2\x96 a cartoon from the mid-90s \xc2\x96 featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing. Aeon, played by the lovely Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a cold detached rebel who is as dexterous as a line-dancer and as deadly as a viper-snake. She needs to be, if she expects to kick the asses of the totalitarian government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love science fiction, but hate the sudden influx of half-assed futuristic dystopian technology-overdosed films like The Island (2005) and Equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the pile). Aeon Flux has all the problems that are present in these films, but amplified. That is, there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the sleek style that Matrix (1999) catalyzed. The special effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux which earns it a few points, but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch. Charlize Theron&#39;s character Aeon Flux is interwoven with the most cheesy tough-chick schtick and it seems as though the director Karyn Kusama cannot quite decide where to go with her next \xc2\x96 should she make her more detached or more emotional? She doesn&#39;t know! Let&#39;s go both ways! Imagine you take a shotgun, load it chock-full of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film Aeon Flux puts forward all the &#39;mandatory&#39; ideas in a dystopian society - individual vs. society, nature vs. science, emotion vs. cold reason, etc. You&#39;ve seen all of this before, and better done at that. Go read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even watch Logan&#39;s Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982)... anything! Avoid this viciously uninvolving cheese-fest for as long as you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10&#34;
b&#39;Yes, it might be not historically accurate(actually only 6 soldiers of 9th rota were killed there), and yes, it has some mistakes and exaggeration(bended machine gun? come on! or the that &#34;history lesson&#34; about how Afghanistan was never conquered by anyone - educated Russian officer would know history much better than that - take for example British campaign in Afghanistan). And yes, it does not have multi-million dollars Hollywood-style special effects, but it\&#39;s strongest point in showing soldier\&#39;s life there, their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are being killed in front of their eyes. In my opinion 9ya rota really does a good job showing all those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, movie has it weaknesses, but, in my opinion, it appears to be one of the strongest Russian movie for the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&#39;
b&#34;I do not know what today&#39;s movie goers expect, but after 68 years of movie watching.. (Well maybe I didn&#39;t watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years, so make that 58 years of movie watching) I expect to be entertained, not bored to tears, assaulted by continuous profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood splattering and body parts being mangled. Surveillance is one of those movies that was made by people who have NO imagination, little if any talent, a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on, long after the purpose for it has elapsed. That anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie, when it is nothing more that Hollywood garbage is beyond me. As a combat veteran I have seen violence, blood and gore, in many forms, and movies like We were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get, but it has redeeming value. Surveillance must have been dreamed up by persons in a drug induced stupor, with no writing ability, no directorial training, no experience in film editing, and a total lack of contact with reality. Just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as FBI agents, setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops, etc.. A high priced piece of garbage that only an idiot could like...&#34;
b&#34;Before I sat down and watched this film on HBO, I wasn&#39;t expecting nothing but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common plot. Well, that&#39;s exactly what I got out of it, except that I was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie. I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be, I thought it was just going to be another hour and a half that I had on my hands to waste. Well, it was, but still it was somewhat worth it. The whole plot was very stupid, cheap acting, and some of the lines were very very dumb. Otherwise than that, it still had it&#39;s funny moments, even though not many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you&#39;re going to rent this, don&#39;t. Watch it on television. I gave it a 4, I was generous because it made me laugh, but yet it was still pretty stupid.&#34;
b&#34;I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The story line was very thin and the editing crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an unlikable character that I found it hard to be supportive of him. Andy&#39;s acting ability is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andie MacDowell did a fine job with her portrayal of Linda, Gary&#39;s romantic interest. I can not say anything bad about Andie, I always enjoy her acting. The problem here is that the romance between Andy and Andie is so far fetched and unbelievable. The two do not make a good pair on the big screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end of the movie was almost as much of a let down as the movie itself. A nod from the Pope and all is forgiven, come on. The event that allows this movie to have a some what happy ending and that the writers would expect us to accept it is pathetic. Gary does not change and only by the death of a dear friend does his situation get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are tons of great movies that should be seen before this one. Don&#39;t waste your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#39;The first movie of this series was well written and original. This show drags on, poorly written gags, boring flashbacks, not the comedy that I expected. Even the young folks found it boring. There are certainly bright moments, historical elements and some good acting, but overall I can only recommend this for DVD/tape at home.&#39;
b&#34;Fellow noir devotees, be not deceived, this is a stinker...poorly filmed, poorly acted and there is nothing...nothing here for the film buff looking for yet another solid B-movie from the goldmine of the 40&#39;s &amp; 50&#39;s era of classics. I gave it a try based on the relatively high rating on IMDb. There&#39;s no accounting for taste, but I found nothing in this movie to recommend to other IMDb members. This is a classic example of having watched a movie and feeling like you have been cheated out of x number of minutes that it took the movie to get to its thankful demise. To have Alan Ladd on the cover of the DVD/tape is nearly fraud, he is on camera less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue! This isn&#39;t This Gun For HIre folks...it is a classic in the lousy sense of the studios cranking out fodder on no budget...We all search for the great ones... save your time on Gangs, Inc./Paper Bullets...it is lousy!&#34;
b&#39;This has got to be the WORSE move I\&#39;ve EVER seen!!!!! It was not only boring, it was &#34;gag me with a spoon&#34; dumb. Where\&#39;d ya find the actors ... on a street corner? Who did the special effects...Maaco? For God\&#39;s sakes I could have made a better movie with my CELL PHONE. And if that wasn\&#39;t bad enough, you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see just how stupid the actors are in real life. Who ever did the makeup for the aliens...must have spent $5 at your local used costume store and called it a day. And who in the world wrote up the movie description on the back of the DVD case should be shot. PUHLEEZ!! It\&#39;s not even 1/8 % of what it is described as. That description is just to suck people in to buying, renting or paying a ticket to see it. No wonder there was never a trailer to it....ya would have drove them all away!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad Actors...$5 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Effects...$5.50 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake Fire....$1.89 (cigarette lighter) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time Spent Watching This Movie....total waste! (I should sue ya for my time watching it)&#39;
b&#39;Stop me if you hard this one before, some cheerleaders, their coach and a couple guys are trapped within a cabin in the woods when an unseen killer kills them off one by one. Shame on me, after I totally wrote off Jim Wynorski after the horrid &#34;Busty Cops&#34; (it was a long time coming as his last truly good film was 1990\&#39;s &#34;Hard to Die&#34;), I still for some reason got my hopes up for a supposed sequel to &#34;Slumber Party Massacre&#34;. Sadly even my mediocre expectations were not met. This outing is not nearly as fun as even the three previous films in the franchise (and yes I\&#39;m including SPM 2, that should tell you something) Furthermore how can you have a slasher film with this little gore??? I mean Come on now!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: D &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Candy: Ricky Ray gets topless; April Flowers and Charity Rahmer show boobs and buns in a shower scene (April gets nude again later in the film), and Tamie Sheffield gets topless and bares buns&#39;
b&#34;We&#39;re in a not so distant future, globalization seems to have reached a high point, languages mixes with each other (although English prevails over the rest), races have merged, human clonation is a fact, and all the territory seems to have been divided in two zones: the one for the valid and the one for the non-valid... a brave new world (in Aldous Huxley&#39;s style) in which people are genetically filed and blood relationships are strictly forbidden (for health reasons \xc2\x96that&#39;s the Code 46 of the title-). In such environment two souls that are destined not to meet fall in love with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winterbottom had an important story, with quite a big potential. A nice recipe that he ruins giving it a so slow rhythm, narrating it in a so weary way, removing any emotions... Coldness, that&#39;s all Code 46 transmits. Coldness and boredom. Not even the presence of Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (both of&#39;em play their roles wonderfully) , nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the movie. What a pity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Code 46: what could have been and never was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My rate: 4/10&#34;
b&#34;Finally, I can connect the dots between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace. We see here where Lucas lost touch with what made the original Star Wars films great and began to descend into the plot less tripe that ruined episodes 1-3. This film is more like one of those cheesy low-budget 80s swords and sorcerer films than anything worthy of being associated with the Star Wars saga. As with the Jar-Jar character, this seems targeted at children (and the toy market). The battle scenes are particularly bad. It was depressing to see Sian Phillips&#39; incredible talent go to such a waste, after her classic performance in I, Claudius.&#34;
b&#34;A previous IMDb reviewer has stated that &#39;Rafter Romance&#39; is a &#39;rip-off&#39; (that&#39;s the other reviewer&#39;s term) of a German musical called &#39;Me By Day, You By Night&#39;. Apparently that reviewer is unaware that *both* of these films have borrowed their premise from &#39;Box and Cox&#39;, an English play written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. This play deals with two tradesmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady, each man believing himself the sole tenant. Because the two men have different work schedules, the ruse is not discovered straight away. This play was once so popular in Britain that &#39;to Box and Cox it&#39; became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared accommodations meant for only one person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The innovation of &#39;Rafter Romance&#39; (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman, who inevitably develop a romance. As is usual in these cornball movies, the guy and the gal detest each other until they fall into each other&#39;s arms. Hoo boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The landlord in this film is played by George Sidney, a character actor who specialised in playing Jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic. George Sidney was never as annoying as the odious Harry Green (the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit) but Sidney&#39;s depictions of Jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single most notable thing about &#39;Rafter Romance&#39; is that, to my knowledge, this is the earliest Hollywood film to make reference to Hitler and the rise of Nazism. At one point in this movie, landlord Eckbaum (Sidney) discovers his teenage son Julius engaged in chalking swastikas on the walls. Eckbaum and his son are clearly meant to be Jewish. Admittedly, nobody in Hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what Hitler was planning for the Jews in Europe ... still, it&#39;s surprising to see a film depicting a Jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke. His father is, quite properly, angered by this display of the Nazi symbol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major Hollywood studios continued to do business with the Third Reich as late as 1939. Hollywood&#39;s leading ladies were medically documented as &#39;Aryan&#39; so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, Hollywood&#39;s leading men were documented as &#39;Aryan and uncircumcised&#39;. Except for Darryl Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox, all the Hollywood studio executives who colluded in this policy were Jewish ... but clearly had no objection to doing business with Hitler. I&#39;m surprised that &#39;Rafter Romance&#39; contains a scene depicting swastikas unfavourably, as this sequence would have rendered the film Verboten in Germany and Austria. (Maybe the scene was cut out for German release: it isn&#39;t crucial to the movie&#39;s plot.) Apart from this, the movie contains nothing notable. Robert Benchley does his usual unfunny befuddled characterisation: I&#39;ve never understood the appeal of this man. I&#39;ll rate &#39;Rafter Romance&#39; 4 out of 10.&#34;
b&#39;The first DH wasn\&#39;t that great, but I really didn\&#39;t expect it to be. But this horrible movie was just beyond criticism. I really try to look on the bright side and give movies like this a chance, but I just could not find a real good thing about this one. I appreciate what Bill Cowell was trying to do, but this movie was just soooooo boring. The story of the movie really isn\&#39;t that bad. In fact, it\&#39;s somewhat original. But the movie form is really as bad as a lot of people say. In my opinion, this one ranks right up there with &#34;The Off Season&#34;, and &#34;Dracula 3000&#34;. I know a lot of people really trash and put down movies like this, but I really can\&#39;t think of any other good things to say about it.&#39;
b&#39;A long time ago, way back in the early \&#39;80s, a late-night TV show &#34;Fridays&#34; came to ABC, trying to steal the limelight away from NBC\&#39;s badly-listing &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34;. It didn\&#39;t but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semi-talented &#34;comedians&#34; to the world. Like Mark Blankenfield, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which, in a roundabout way, brings us to &#34;Jekyll and Hyde... Together Again&#34;. Which is repugnant in ways all its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after Communion. And about as tasteful, too. This is just his drugged-out druggist character he played on the ill-fated &#34;Fridays&#34; show stretched out to feature length. And if you didn\&#39;t like him there, why are you reading this review?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie, that\&#39;s a bad sign. Then when it goes for dunder-headed jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the Western hemisphere and replaces gags with gross-out, things can only get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A comic take on a Robert Louis Stevenson story? About as good an idea as making a sitcom out of Poe\&#39;s &#34;Fall of the House of Usher&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from a few (VERY few) gags that give a slight grin, this whole film is an exercise in waste - wasted actors, wasted film, wasted opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder they showed original author Stevenson turning in his grave. What more observant a review could they give themselves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No stars. No, not even for Armstrong, who should have known better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Hyde&#34; from this one.&#39;
b&#39;If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining, then you\&#39;re bound to enjoy Surveillance. This film was garbage for both the mind and spirit. The notion that this is a &#34;thriller&#34; is comical; that would imply some kind of tension and twists. You kept waiting for the story to actually finish &#34;starting&#34;. It never rises above a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Picture all of the violence of &#34;No Country for Old Men&#34; without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters. Thrill-killers run amok. The acting is good, mostly, but the script is a pile. Don\&#39;t bother, and tell your friends to don\&#39;t bother.&#39;
b&#34;i think south park is hilarious, and i have no problem w/them taking shots at people on the left, but you&#39;d think that, after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities for risking their careers taking on an illegal war, and then being GASP right along, they would have the sense to start giving w. and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two. bush seems to get a pretty free run from these guys for as stupid and messed up as he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gore is fair game, but please, what do the republicans have to do, how bad do they have to f^&amp;k up the country before these guys finally act like maybe they aren&#39;t just trying to do the best they can, and that they have done some true screwing up...or maybe just go after rush limbaugh...hes a good target...or even just make fun of condoleeza rice&#39;s gap teeth.&#34;
b&#34;I caught this on Cinemax very late at night...nothing else was on so I pretty much had no choice. Bottom line, terrible plot, slow, waste of good film and actors&#39; time. To make it short, don&#39;t even bother with this one. It&#39;s too bad we can&#39;t give zeros as a rating; this one really is not worth even a consideration!!!&#34;
b&#39;I admit - I was lured to this one from the hype - and I didn\&#39;t stop to consider the sources. &#34;one of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year (1999)&#34;, shocking&#34;, and &#34; a must have &#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well - I wasted my money. But not all was bad in this movie. THey at least got the gore right, as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time. There is even a storyline (kinda) and that is about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content - but no exploiting. We get gay sex - sorta. We have 3 inter-racial babes - maybe. We have a psychotic Vietnamese hooker - nice back, oral sex (ok that made me wince) and some female version of Gene Simmons (I don\&#39;t get that part). We have an honest to goodness Capone - rates among the best of the actors in this film - that is not a compliment. And finally we have a government conspiracy thrown in to - I don\&#39;t know - try to connect the vengeance/random/theme killing by Jimmy boy to make the Vietnamese psycho seem sane??????? If nothing else this movie proves that the Italians and the Americans do not have a lock on this type of movie. The Latinos can make crap as well as the rest of them. Kudos goes to anyone involved in this accomplishment that overcame it and made a career for themselves.&#39;
b&#34;While I agree that this was the most horrendous movie ever made, I am proud to say I own a copy simply because myself and a bunch of my friends were extras (mostly in the dance club scenes, but a few others as well. This movie had potential with Bolo and the director of Enter the Dragon signed on, but as someone who was on set most every day I can tell you that Robert Clouse was an old and confused individual, at least during the making of this movie. It was a wonder he could find his way to the set everyday. I would also like to think that this might have been a better movie if a lot of it had not been destroyed in a fire at Morning Calm studios. I can&#39;t say that it would have been for sure, but it would be nice to think so. I was actually surprised that it was ever released, and that someone like Bolo would attach his name to it without a fight. Oh well. Also look at the extras for pro wrestler Scott Levy, AKA Raven. He was a wrestler in Portland at the time...nice guy, very smart.&#34;
b&#39;I saw this film last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I\&#39;m worried I\&#39;m turning into one of those left-wing liberals they rightly make fun of in South Park. Because I found it hugely offensive. Am I being ridiculously sensitive? Firstly, there\&#39;s the old staple that is America being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, and chillingly, there is the early meteor strike hitting some (unnamed \xc2\x96 why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in &#34;my god, imagine the tragedy that *could* happen&#34;. Because, you know, it happened to Asians. It might happen to white Americans, and *that* would be tragic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, later on, a bigger meteor hits Paris. Our cast on the ground are irritated, because this might mean our boys have less time than they thought. Not much upset in America. No mention that a lot of people have died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there\&#39;s Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted. Never has a black man been so token. Among a team of hardcore drillers, his job seems to consist of standing in the back, occasionally saying &#34;Hey, you da man.&#34; Really. Why did they even bring him? It\&#39;s not like he\&#39;s petite - he weighed down that shuttle for nothing! Not once does he lift a tool, steer a space ship or even help fix anything that blows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you ignore the Russian Cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor wasted in a pointless role), who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with spanners instead of fixing them because &#34;Dat\&#39;s how we do dese dings in Russia&#34;, it\&#39;s pretty horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All cemented of course by the site of blond, blue-eyed American children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything being all right. Because all the death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You expect the bad script, the dodgy acting, the implausible plot (fat, middle aged men being trained in 12 days to be astronauts? Including one who appears to be retarded?). But I couldn\&#39;t believe the racism and xenophobia implied in the film, and the callous disregard for the lives of anyone not corn-fed American.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a chilling indictment of the attitude of a section of Western Society to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it\&#39;s a crappy film too.&#39;
b&#39;Code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love, and in fact will punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person. The haves and the have-nots live in completely separate territories, the powers that be can remove your memories, etc. We\&#39;ve seen this stuff before, but that\&#39;s OK- no movie is 100% original. This kind of premise is always fun to contemplate. Unfortunately, just imagining such a future is more interesting than actually watching Code 46. The characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. Maybe that\&#39;s commentary on a dehumanized future, but it\&#39;s still dull to watch. It\&#39;s sloooow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At times the imagery is nice, but usually (coupled with its &#34;evocative&#34; soundtrack) just looks like a glorified perfume commercial. Code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camera-work that I find annoying. You know, two characters talk as the camera artlessly &#34;floats&#34; on one side. Two seconds later it\&#39;s floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends liked this movie. If they tried to get me to watch it again, I probably would not do so unless they agreed to pay me $50.&#39;
b&#39;this movie has NO plot. it was SUPPOSED to be that a guy moves in with his grandma, and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he\&#39;s living with? they have a big pot party at grandma\&#39;s house. the climax of the movie didn\&#39;t even relate to the rest of it. that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movie\&#39;s end. i can see how it COULD have related to the supposed story - that Grandma\&#39;s VG skills redeem him - but that just wasn\&#39;t there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the movie was funny as hell and clearly relied heavily on the jokes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Her pussy smells like the great depression&#34; &#34;He just sucked his first titty...yeah for 13 hours&#34; &#34;It\&#39;s for you...i think it\&#39;s the Devil&#34;&#39;
b&#39;Sorry this was a woeful excuse for a film.. a plot line so holey it resembled a block of swiss cheese and a butch of characters who seemed to me to be utterly devoid of inter-personal relations.. Well except of course for Carlyle and Lee-Miller who i could have sworn were meant to be in love.. Unlike the union of Tyler and Miller who were for the most part, like the rest of the film, utterly unconvincing.. although the end product was uncaptivating and amusing for all the wrong reasons, the production values were high and deserve some acknowledgement..but unfortunately the end result was rubbish..what was everyone involved thinking..? they definitely should have packed up early on this one..&#39;
b&#39;I bought the video for \xc2\xa313 at HMV (we pay more in Britain) as a friend had told me it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the opening credits were a let down...the dancing/music not very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The car ride and unexpected crash just as the lady passenger was going to be harmed was a nice touch,..something unexpected...though the way she walked away from the car with hair perfectly groomed and still carrying a handbag looked corny for most Directors ..but for Lynch was something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her dazed walking around after such a shock was enhanced by a regular low noise similar to fingers scraping along a blackboard; I thought another Lynch master touch perhaps portraying the demons gnawing into her shocked and traumatised self conscious. After a while this noise became somewhat annoying and on further investigation I discovered the new video cassette squeaked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know whether this squeak took away a lot of my enjoyment but this movie became a waste of time.(and money)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fair enough, though predictable. There were no male characters of any merit and apart from a few vaguely good scenes (the hoover switching on )there were far too many dreadful scenes that were plain weak and ridiculous. Eg, the coffee being spat into the napkin by the menacing loon and the silly monster face at the back of the diner. Oh and what about the paint in the wifes jewels..boring and naff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole film gives you the feel of the failed genius..you know when you listen to the worst Dylan track ever and think my God that was embarrassing....was that really Bob?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole feel is that of a failed TV movie , badly put together with a few (not many) extra bits to give it a 15 rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I whizzed it on during the last 30 minutes .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I give it another chance and watch again. If I want to be puzzled and work hard at understanding a film I will watch Frank Woods Guide to Consolidated Accounting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynch did one classic ..Blue Velvet and Straight Story was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, like Wild at Heart, was a let down ; his weirdness is now predictable and stale. Anybody want to buy a 2nd hand video?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make way for some younger original talent, David.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four out of Ten (and no more). Sorry.&#39;
b&#34;The movie is not as funny as the director&#39;s preceding (and only other) movie, Shanghai Noon. Showtime did have its moments, but it did not satisfy me. Why it needed to be so foulmouthed, I don&#39;t know, but I give Showtime **/****&#34;
b&#39;GOOD: Technomusic accompanying medieval swordplay. Also, the movie looks sleeker than most b-movies, but let\&#39;s face it: Quake or Doom has more atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD: Unintelligent plot, no acting and totally unbelievable universe. I am usually able to see the potential of even very bad movies; heck, I love a good B-movie like &#34;Split Second&#34; and the likes. But this one has has nothing but boredom and clich\xc3\xa9 to offer... Totally predictable from start to end. Oh, and I forgot the lousy special effects, they look more like an old Playstation game than anything out of myth! The use of a classic poem to sell this sucker offends me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: Quite simply boring. If you want to see Lara Croft, buy the game, it\&#39;s way sexier!&#39;
b&#39;THE PROTECTOR. You hear the name. You think, &#34;ah, it\&#39;s a crappy Hong Kong movie.&#34; Guess what - it\&#39;s not Hong Kong. And yes, it is crappy. This amazingly stupid Jackie Chan film, ruined by us, yes us, the Americans (I\&#39;m boiling with anger, ooh, I think I\&#39;ll jump out that window!), has Chan as a New York cop hunting down a gang, avenging the death of his buddy. Sounds cool...but it\&#39;s not. Don\&#39;t waste your money renting it. To prove he could make a better cop film, Chan made the amazing POLICE STORY (1985).&#39;
b&#34;Actually I&#39;m still in doubt if there&#39;s anything about this movie I like. As for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The acting was too bad in my opinion. Not very likely that Antonie Kamerling will get a Rutger Hauer status. Some folks will expect it anyway. First let him work on his English pronunciation. If you watch the &#39;trip&#39; to Paris of these actors (DVD-extra) you will most likely want to trow up. Advice to Beau Dorens: stop your acting career, you&#39;ll never get there... To the 2 main &#39;actors&#39;: grow up, please. Being generous, I&#39;d give it 4 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#39;I realize it\&#39;s a small statistical sampling (8 votes as of this posting), but 5.9 out of 10? I\&#39;m giving this movie a 3 and even that\&#39;s generous. I\&#39;ve tried to watch this movie three times now (the Saturday night 9 p.m. premiere on SciFi Channel, and the Saturday night at 1 a.m. and Thursday night re-broadcasts) and I\&#39;ve fallen asleep all three times before the movie ends. Which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions. For example, is Lance Henriksen that strapped for cash that he has to keep playing supporting roles in these god-awful &#34;Pumpkinhead&#34; sequels? Is Henriksen contractually banned from doing any non-&#34;Pumpkinhead&#34; movies? Can\&#39;t the creators of this franchise do better than a monster that looks like a geriatric, emaciated &#34;Alien&#34; who walks like he has a stick jammed up his a**? When are the hick characters in these movies going to realize that handguns and rifles don\&#39;t hurt the &#34;Pumpkinhead?&#34; Why don\&#39;t they try jamming another stick up this thing\&#39;s a** instead? And, lastly, are the writers of this movie so creatively challenged that they couldn\&#39;t come up with names for the two feuding families more original than the Hatfields and the McCoys? While you\&#39;re at it, why not write a screenplay about a fictional president and name him George Bush? Someday I may have the mental stamina to watch this movie all the way through without drifting off to sleep. Until then, if somebody has the answers, please let me know.&#39;
b&#39;I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor, but this &#34;movie&#34; left me stunned in my chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s so bad that it could just not have been any worse. Not once did I laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie. I have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies, but unfortunately this one will allways be the one I remember best - in my nightmares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason anyone should want to watch this, is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst movie ever.&#39;
b&#34;Well, i thought the movie was blah 1/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways the best part is the first 5 minutes of the film with the nerd&#39;s or whatever girlfriend, this is the part u guys watch out for Tho she had big hooters, i thought is that really a random actor? Heck no, it wasn&#39;t it was actually a model by the name of Larissa McComas but u already knew that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that made sense but that was about it rest of the film (that i saw anyway) didn&#39;t care 4, and didn&#39;t bother watching the rest of it That&#39;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all i needed to C to be satisfied so 2 those of u that just care for that well there u go enjoy&#34;
b&#34;The obsession of &#39;signifie&#39; and &#39;signifiant&#39; is not enough to make a good film. Pascal Bonitzer should have remained in our memory as a brilliant film theorist back in the &#39;60\xc2\xb4s. It was not necessary to take the camera. The result is quite frustrating. It\xc2\xb4s a pity for his excellent leading actors.&#34;
b&#34;This one is a bit more stylish than the average erotic thriller and Peta Wilson is a very sexy presence but it plays like they lost a few pages of script somewhere. Subplots come in and out of nowhere, the connections between some of the characters are murky and the killer&#39;s motivation is unclear to say the least. Maybe they could get away with this in a porn version, but here some more clarification is needed.&#34;
b&#39;I first heard of this film when Patton Oswalt talked about it on his &#34;Werewolves and Lollipops&#34; CD. He said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. Being a lover of terrible cinema, I knew I was in for a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is, hands down, one of the weirdest I\&#39;ve ever seen. Certainly one of the weirdest shlock films. Basically, a demon took human form years ago for a woman, the woman died or something, the demon cried blood, the blood fell on the bed, the bed is now possessed and it now eats. Along with fruit, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. The people can range between horny teens, mayors, gangsters, servants or professional orgy throwers. There\&#39;s also a sick guy who the bed ate but put his soul behind a picture in the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most movies let you figure out the plot through exciting action. Death Bed takes another path: it basically tells you through narration exactly what\&#39;s happening while slow, dull murder scenes take place. Also, I must say everyone who\&#39;s eaten by the bed are surprisingly quiet. I would think if a bed is eating you through the ways of a 5th grade science fair experiment, it would sting a little. I guess nerve endings weren\&#39;t invented until 1981 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is wacky, the direction is slow and pretty awful, the sets are sparse, the acting it fairly painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors I\&#39;ve ever seen. Probably would make a great party film if alcohol and smart-asses are involved. Certainly one you shouldn\&#39;t miss.&#39;
b&#39;WEBS is a pretty odd movie, albeit slightly watchable. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who gets suck into a parallel Earth overrun by mutant spiders, or something like that. The film itself was made with a modest budget, which explains the limited locales, and the somewhat tedious screenplay that manages to do very little with quite an interesting premise. Basically a 90 minute episode of the TV show &#34;Sliders&#34;, and nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review and reviews of other films in the genre)&#39;
b&#39;Just plain terrible. Nick and Michael are WAY better actors than this. A &#34;C&#34; rated flick at best. The plot was weak and the characters totally undeveloped. Even the film and sound quality was terrible. I suppose that these were all young actors at the time and this script just filled a job nitch.&#39;
b&#39;I was not old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone thought it was cool. I have some of the &#34;books&#34; that were written based on the series in my screen-to-print collection, and they\&#39;re pretty light duty, so I didn\&#39;t expect much from the movie. That\&#39;s a good thing, because this movie was bad on a long leash. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the 1960\&#39;s hit. The movie audience, though, has gained sophistication in 30 years. At least, I think so. I certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original Mod Squad concept, with (now old) car chases, (now considered poor) camera work, (tinny sounding) soundtrack and (poor) script and all, on the big screen. In the 1960s, we didn\&#39;t care as much because we had minimal expectations. An integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough. It was that, another thrilling episode of &#34;Ironsides&#34; or &#34;Password.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating this &#34;episode&#34; against usual theatre releases, the story was...well, I\&#39;m not sure I should even say because I\&#39;m not sure there was one. Drugs are bad? Whatever. The script was silly. When the characters are exchanging dialog and advancing the plot with lines like &#34;I overheard him say so on the phone,&#34; and &#34;I think I got a plan,&#34; we really are in trouble. No wonder the acting was dreadful: no one knew how to say such idiotic lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were Claire Danes, I\&#39;d be going after my agent with a flame-thrower right now. (Actually, I think everyone in and watching the film has a right to seek retribution.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And where was the Mod in that Squad? I realize these kids just got out of juvenile hall, but no one had a velvet suit? &#34;Mod&#34; only meant young and integrated? What happened to white go-go boots? Perhaps the costume department was going for gritty, but all they got was dirty and dingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the movie was completely true to the original series, and required special behavior from the actors, cameramen, stunt men, etc., we should appreciate it more. Unfortunately, I still don\&#39;t like it. If I wanted to watch 60\&#39;s crime drama, I\&#39;d buy DVDs. No thanks.&#39;
b&#39;The Three Stooges are arguably the greatest comedy team in film history. For that reason alone, they deserved a much better ending at Columbia than they received with this short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Sappy Bullfighters&#34; is just not good. Granted, this is not all Joe Besser\&#39;s fault. I personally feel that some of his shorts are fun enough, simply because of the departure from the Stooges usual fanfare that they contain, and for the fact that Larry is sometimes showcased more. However, this short just will not do. And the fact that one knows that it is their last short that was ever shown, well that just adds to the overall disgust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film just epitomizes how short subjects were on their last dying breaths during this time and how little effort went into making them. This short is so sloppy. It is a simple re-make of a Curly short, &#34;What\&#39;s the Matador?&#34;, filmed years before. As if this fact wasn\&#39;t bad enough, the studio actually threw in footage of Moe and Larry from the original (which was filmed nearly 20 years prior). Are these things not obvious? Laughable or sad? You be the judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another part of this short that makes it miserable is the fact that it is basically a Joe Besser showcase, with him showing that all he is (at least in this film) is a Curly-wanna-be-gone-completely-wrong! Moe and Larry have little to do in this short. As a Larry fan, I also must say that I feel it a bit disgraceful to have Besser get to use the joke that Larry originally popularized in the short &#34;Ants In The Pantry&#34;. To see Besser say &#34;I can\&#39;t see, I can\&#39;t see!&#34; and have Larry say the simple &#34;Why can\&#39;t you see?&#34;, while Besser gets to quip &#34;I got my eyes closed&#34;, is just wrong on all levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two brave soldiers who stuck it out for all those years, Howard and Fine, have so little to do in this short. There are hardly any funny bits with them. The only thing that qualifies is Larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, attempting to be &#34;Pepe&#34;, his dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can\&#39;t blame the dynamic duo. Larry and Moe give it their all. No matter how ridiculous things could get (and I\&#39;m sure they had their opinions by this point in their careers) Howard and Fine never gave anything less than their best. Their efforts do not pale from 1934-1959.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often enjoy many shorts that some will dismiss as horrible. I\&#39;m all for their more &#34;experimental&#34;, unusual shorts. At least those contain new ideas. However, this short, I think everyone can agree, is just not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness TV later discovered the boys after the shorts department closed. Had they been forced to go out in THIS fashion, well that would have been a gross injustice to all the years they invested in making audiences laugh.&#39;
b&#34;This movie is awful. If you&#39;re considering to see this movie... two words DO NOT. It&#39;s tasteless, the storyline is really lame, and the jokes are even worse. The acting is really pathetic. I can&#39;t believe that this movie was made. Rather watch American Pie, Going Greek or Road Trip if you&#39;re in the mood for a teen comedy. It&#39;s about two girls who head for Malibu on their Spring Break. As usual they didn&#39;t do much planning and called (i think her names Michelle)&#39;s uncle to crash at his Malibu mansion. Uncle Bennie strictly forbids them of having any kind of party, and as you would of guessed, they go ahead and do it. Please, I urge you, do not see this movie.&#34;
b&#34;Sorry, folks, but all of you that say this is a great documentary... and that award it won at Sundance... well, you&#39;ve all been duped. I&#39;ve heard for a few years how I had to see this documentary and I finally watched it. Maybe in 1999, when it came out, and reality TV didn&#39;t have such a dominant presence in the industry, this movie would have seemed entertaining. But Mike and Mark are so obviously playing themselves, Mike and Mark. At times they are funny and some of the lines seem off the cuff, but mostly they do not ring true. They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes the people are real, they are not actors, but it&#39;s put on, it&#39;s exaggeration of themselves, and it&#39;s so obvious that it&#39;s hard to believe so many people think it&#39;s the real deal. I wasn&#39;t fooled so it was actually a tad boring. Mildly amusing, but not missing much if you miss it.&#34;
b&#39;Some slack might be cut this movie due to the fact that it was made in 1979. That much said, it really is pretty dire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never mind the laughable back-projection or the awful, awful camera-tracking of supposed &#34;in-flight&#34; objects, it\&#39;s the stunts that the Concorde pulls off that will have you blinking in disbelief at the absurdity. Barrel-rolls, loop-the-loops and violent &#34;evasive&#34; maneuvers left me wondering why the Air-Forces of the world didn\&#39;t just fly Concordes as their main fighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese-fest: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Concorde is at least as agile as a Phantom 4 jet-fighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You can fire a flare gun at Mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If the flare gun fails to discharge, do not drop it, as it may then go off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The Concorde can dodge up to two Sidewinder missiles fired at it at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. A flare will distract a heat-seeking missile every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Switching off your jet-engines is a sure-fire way of throwing heat-seeking missiles off track if 5 (above) fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. When performing a crash-landing in the Concorde, it is apparently impossible to jettison your fuel beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Concorde pilots are all combat-trained veterans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you might imagine, this film is not very realistic. The effects are primitive by today\&#39;s standards and that, coupled with the nonsense acrobatics the Concorde performs, makes this a movie deserving of little but scorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended. Not recommended at all!&#39;
b&#34;This movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named Curtis killing people. The other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that Curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge, brown, ugly glasses. The actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to Revenge of the Nerds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet time shooting people. I kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice? He sounded like he was fourteen and not ten. Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there. That didn&#39;t make any sense and neither did the music. The music didn&#39;t fit any of the scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch a different movie on your birthday.&#34;
b&#34;Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them. Other than that I can&#39;t think of a reason to justify the film&#39;s existence. Not that it isn&#39;t amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy&#39;s character. I can&#39;t seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. When I was working person at New York State Crime Victims Board I had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but I can&#39;t think of one who thought that this was just something I do until I get my career going in an area far afield. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who&#39;s on the trail of a major gun dealer. He&#39;s undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does the showboating Murphy do, he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So DeNiro&#39;s bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series. So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro&#39;s case with all the TV cameras around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie Murphy&#39;s a funny guy, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies, but he&#39;s done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film.&#34;
b&#34;Proof if ever more was needed, that an action movie, irregardless of its budget, can LOOK better with more setups (or cameras), closer shots, and many more cuts. The &#39;Martini&#39; generation has moved on to John Woo. Deep Fault could be better for a work over in the cutting room. Ray&#34;
b&#34;I saw this movie previewed before something else I rented a while back...and it looked decent. I&#39;ve seen some good stuff from Full Moon video, and thought it was worth a shot... Unfortunately, this was not good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is about a possessed bed. A couple moves into a new apartment, discovers the bed, and odd things start happening. Odd things like the woman discovers kinky sex. And the man discovers kinky sex. And the woman draws pictures of kinky sex. And the man photographs kinky sex. And they both start having dreams about dead people having kinky sex. You&#39;d think a movie with so much kinky sex would be good, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.... No. The problem is that this is supposed to be a scary movie, or at least a thriller, and it just doesn&#39;t deliver. There is little tension, no suspense, and no fear. Aside from some troubling dreams and visions, there really isn&#39;t anything for this couple to be worried about. The whole movie is basically the two of them having these visions and playing around in bed. Sure, you get a monster fight at the end...and some bloodshed...but nothing spectacular... There&#39;s only one murder, and one good scare, and that&#39;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the kinky sex? Don&#39;t get your hopes up (or anything else for that matter). Their idea of kinky sex is woman on top, fully clothed, trying to strangle her mate with a necktie. Not exactly my idea of a good time.&#34;
b&#34;Cheerleader Massacre was supposed to be the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series; if that&#39;s what they were doing (which it is considering ONE actress from the original returns in a small cameo role), they have failed miserably and made, by far, the worst installment of the &#39;quadrilogy&#39;. Cheerleader Massacre seamlessly combines bad acting, a horrible plot, a dumb killer, dull and boring deaths, boring scenery, and hideous camera work to make it one of the worst films ever made. Did I already mention how bad it was? Don&#39;t get me wrong: this cheesy and retarded excuse for a horror film is nowhere near as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, but it is undeniably a horrible movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheerleader Massacre is an exact polar opposite of the original Slumber Party Massacre. Stay away by all means! This movie is utter garbage!&#34;
b&#39;Although I have rarely flown myself, I am keenly interested in aviation... and this film has added to the precious laughing stock in aviation cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Why is the captain doing the ground checks? Why does he even measure the oil levels in the engines? With turnaround times as low as 15 minutes in commercial aviation this is not a typical pre-flight check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. WHY does the captain KICK against the aircraft tire? Strange kind of pressure check. Or anger management :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The cockpit has a crew of 3. All large, western, two-engined jets built since the 1980ies have a crew of 2 people. Now try a guess at how old the movie script is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. A helicopter manages to fly alongside the crippled airliner. Must be a fast one... and the captain\&#39;s words to explain the &#34;maneuver&#34; to the passengers are indeed hilarious ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. With arrested elevator rudders it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft. It happens, for example, when any aircraft moves slower than the stall speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The elevator rudders have hydraulic actuators. After the collision with the business plane it would, most probably, have severed the hydraulic lines and thus make them useless for steering, but it would NOT fix them in certain position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The fire in the aft galley was a stupid idea. It was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the extinguisher and fight the fire, regardless of who was actually trained to do that \xc2\x96 the flight attendant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. At the time of collision, the aircraft\&#39;s elevators would have been in a neutral position. The film could have ended here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. The flight engineer (the third person in the cockpit) has three bars on his uniform. In reality, flight engineers have two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Why does the captain slash the cabin casing with an axe to examine the damage behind? I thought it would have been the flight engineer\&#39;s duty, as he is already supposed to perform technical checks before and after flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. In any aircraft, there is no unused space. At least commercial airplanes cannot afford the luxury of a compartment that can be filled with tons of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on... but at last I laughed hysterically about how the screenwriters imagine aircraft disasters! Woooohooo! Most aircraft disasters happen in such a short time span that you simply cannot make 90-minute flicks out of them. But you can always fill 90 minutes with mind-boggling and insane crap, irrespective of the genre.&#39;
b&#34;This film was the one of the first, of the 70s women-in-prison film genre. This movie was incredibly violent, with lots of sadistic torture being inflicted on the inmates. The film takes place in the Phillipines, which looks like a horribly ugly country. No doubt, the producers used this factor to their advantage, to emphasize the gruesome situation that the prisoners were in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blaxploitation movie queen Pam Grier, has the starring role in this movie. She plays Blossom, a renegade who gets thrown in the vile women&#39;s prison, on trumped-up charges. Her boyfriend, played by Sid Haig, tries to rescue Blossom. He and Blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction, and Blossom&#39;s incarceration was orchestrated by the corrupt, Phillipino government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam Grier and Sid Haig, stand-out amongst the otherwise lackluster cast. The film itself, put way too much emphasis on violence perpetrated against the prisoners. Their captors just used them solely as objects of their sadism. This got boring real fast. This movie could&#39;ve used more interesting plot-lines, and subtlety. This is not one of Roger Corman&#39;s better pictures. The many women-in-prison films that followed this one, were much better all around. I&#39;d recommend The Big Bird Cage, only to Pam Grier fans.&#34;
b&#39;This was supposed to be set in the &#34;Bible Belt&#34; of Northern Ireland. Well, as someone who grew up there,and was a child in the era depicted in the film it just didn\&#39;t ring true! The accents were all over the place - anything but County Antrim/Derry. The church didn\&#39;t resemble any I have ever seen. &#34;The Church of God&#34; is a pentecostal denomination but the one in the film was certainly not pentecostal! The elderly minister at the beginning was dressed in the robes of the Church of Ireland (Anglican)- and no C.of I. would call itself &#34;The Church of God&#34;. The minister was often addressed as &#34;Reverend&#34; - they may do that in some parts of the world but I never heard it when I lived in that area. Ministers were addressed as &#34;Mr ......&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was very badly researched and cast - fairly typical of Irish cinema - annoying! A film can have a great plot, but if it doesn\&#39;t look authentic, it is rubbish.&#39;
b&#39;I\&#39;d never heard of zero budget &#34;auteur&#34; Neil Johnson before seeing &#34;Battlespace&#34; on DVD at Hollywood Video. A few minutes into the movie I realize this isn\&#39;t a bad thing. Like many straight to video Sci-Fi movies, this is a film dominated largely by overused bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci-fi concepts that fail to create a story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewers are tortured with a religious sounding text introduction, then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the main character\&#39;s daughter. To me this seemed like a smoke screen to mask a film with militantly ugly visuals and zero character emphasis. Some people on here seem all too ready to take this film seriously and swallowed it\&#39;s seemingly new age messages hook line and sinker. These favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can delude themselves into thinking that things like &#34;Battlefield Earth&#34; was a brilliant movie, or that Shasta is just as good as Coke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who were lured in by the cheesy cover art can look forward to lousy acting (in small doses, spaced with long blocks of people not talking), rotten computer animated effects (in extra large doses), and irritating talking computers. What you won\&#39;t get is excitement, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogue, or a good story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Battlespace&#34; is impenetrable bull and the constant irritant of the narration proves it. Real science fiction, hell, real film-making, is about characters and their dialogue, not special effects and dull predictions. This is right down there with similar direct to video sci-fi like &#34;Cl.One&#34; and &#34;Recon 2022&#34;. If the boredom of &#34;Strange Horizons&#34; and &#34;Alien Visitor&#34; is something you seek out, by all means, watch the crap out of this. If you enjoy good storytelling and hate fake lens flares, you\&#39;re better off with a real movie.&#39;
b&#34;I&#39;m trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film maker. As I was telling friends during my lunch hour, MirrorMask may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year. Just like the short Moongirl, the film missed its marks. Several times during the movie it made attempts at humor. It sets you up for the laugh. Instead of making you laugh, it leaves you feeling empty. The jokes reminded one of the recent Star Wars films. They weren&#39;t funny unless you were five. And the acting felt similarly terrible. I&#39;ve seen actors actually act in front of a blue screen. And I&#39;ve believed it. But not in this film. Not for a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film takes a formula and tries to apply it with pretty artwork\xc2\x85 And though the script is totally workable and the special effects quite beautiful, it has no heart to it and fails miserably. I left the film shaking my head and considered leaving the theater. I felt hallow and miserable and still haven&#39;t gotten the sour taste out of my mouth from it. I love independent film. I encourage people to view independent films to support them. But not this film. This film shouldn&#39;t have been made. At least, not like this. Why did the director miss the marks so clearly? They were clearly setup\xc2\x85 Not just the humor. But the emotions. The drama. Even the lines were poorly timed and delivered. It was like the film walked on three legs instead of four. Its steps are awkward and miss timed. And it could fall over with the slightest push\xc2\x85 Don&#39;t see this film. I don&#39;t care who you are. It isn&#39;t worth your time.&#34;
b&#39;Although my exposure to world cultures is limited, I do try. This was a film that I tried and hated. Worst of all, after hearing so many people decry the shallowness of typical Hollywood fare and its stereotypical caricatures, I saw characters too outrageous for &#34;Eastenders&#34; being paraded as realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clint wants out of the drug life and to do this he aspires to be a waiter. Aim high, I always say. Brad Dorif, or a faxed photo of him, or quite possibly a curly wig on a stick, it was hard to tell, offers to hire Clint if he gets a pair of shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clint, and a huge entourage, apparently wander the whole of England trying to get him some shoes. Eventually, they end up at a suburban home. Whose isn\&#39;t clear. Mum helps a girl shoot up. Oh, now THERE\&#39;S some realism for you! Mrs. Brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha tie off and find a vein. Good God! Dad comes home and sings some Elvis tunes and then chases the kids away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why didn\&#39;t Clint borrow some money and buy shoes at a second hand store? Why didn\&#39;t he go to a church and ask a kindly nun for some help? Why didn\&#39;t he hang out in front of a shoe store and panhandle? I just don\&#39;t know! None of these things seemed to be beneath him. Benevolent groups, like Goodwill and the Salvation Army have stores to help people. I know people who work there! If someone with no money showed up and needed shoes, the staff would give the person some shoes. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but some form of foot covering. Not many of these groups hand out cell phones to the underprivileged, but shoes are usually no problem. What a dumb concept. The world, or at least the western part of it, simply isn\&#39;t that cruel. In England, maybe it\&#39;s from &#34;The Queen\&#39;s Royal Charity&#34; rather than Goodwill, but people who need shoes do get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the quest for shoes, there was no discernable plot to get in the way of the action. Not that it made the movie any quicker or more bearable, mind you. Despite checking the tape jacket several times, I was not watching the 20-hour extended version, it only seemed that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did Clint get his shoes? Did the cardboard cutout of Brad Dourif hire him at the restaurant? Did I ever watch anything else foreign ever again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[spoiler] Yes, yes, and yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fate of this particular film, I decided to end it all. I took out my S&amp;W .45 and shot a half-inch hole through the cassette. Blammo! (I made sure to rewind it first.) I put it back in the tape sleeve, returned it to the rental store, and amazingly NO ONE EVER CALLED TO ASK ABOUT IT!!! Meaning, of course, that no one else rented it for at least the remaining three years I lived in that city. Others knew something that I didn\&#39;t. Live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if you rent something you\&#39;ve never seen before and someone has actually put a bullet through it, take it as a sign. And if you work at the Kroger video department, I\&#39;m just kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Footnote: this classic has yet to see the light of day on DVD, for which we should be eternally thankful to the digital gods.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;De Dominee&#34; is based on the life of a real dutch gangster,Klaas Bruinsma! In the movie he is called Klaas Donkers! I have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened! But that doesn\&#39;t really matter! Because it failed to grab my attention! This movie bored the crap out of me! It lacks substance and style! The substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original! Without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action! Don\&#39;t we need to be entertained? It would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies! It is obvious that he didn\&#39;t! Otherwise he wouldn\&#39;t have made this the way he did! This movie got a lot of publicity because of a little scandal surrounding Klaas Bruinsma and a member of the Dutch Royal family! This scandal has nothing to do with the movie what so ever! Without it &#34;De Dominee&#34; never would have been successful! I am sure of it!&#39;
b&#34;This film is about a young man&#39;s painful journey to discovering his sexuality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is raw and unpretentious. It does not rely on steamy sex scenes to attract the viewers. Though the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected at times, and some events are not properly explained. I can understand it though, because this film is a collection of memories that are highly personal to the director. The subplot of about his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the film, but I can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low budget of the film is clearly discernible. It is a pity that the sound effects are poorly done. The narration and some dialogs (particularly the scene in the classroom with the French teacher) have so much echo, which makes it hard to make out what is said. The ambient noise, notable traffic noise, is also captured throughout the film. When a scene cuts into another, the level of traffic noise changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is probably not entertaining, but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young man&#39;s journey to embracing his sexuality.&#34;
b&#39;Set in a post apocalyptic future, the new highlander is an effeminate little twerp named Quentin MacLeod, who is being mentored by a new Ramirez while his little sister tags along on their quest to thwart an evil immortal overlord. To do so, Quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this overlord, Korton, does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this is pure crap, much like the Highlander sequels. Quentin is a fairly stupid character, constantly whining and moaning and bitching in a &#34;woe is me for I am a reluctant hero&#34; kind of way, and he never catches on to the fact that he\&#39;s an immortal and can\&#39;t be killed, at least not easily. Ramirez would have done better to ditch him and thwart Korton himself.&#39;
b&#39;There seems to have been some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if I hadn\&#39;t actually started watching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, once we are in the cavern with the characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we\&#39;ve been meeting in horror films since the early \&#39;80s), the film is shot almost entirely in close-up. Since the actors are wearing helmet lights, this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness - we never get to see what the characters see; so when they shout out &#34;Look there!&#34; we are left to beg &#34;What?! Where?!&#34;. Ultimately the film has a nauseating, confusing strobe-light effect, with no sense to it until we get to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I won\&#39;t tell you what \&#39;the end\&#39; means - but you will recognize it if you\&#39;ve ever seen the old early \&#39;60s Arch Hall laugh fest&#34;Eegah!&#34; with Richard Kiel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what crazy person would ever want to make a variation on a theme like &#34;Eegah!&#34;\&#39;s, long remembered as one of the worst films ever made?! But that\&#39;s what we have here, folks. Except that, unlike &#34;Eegah!&#34;, &#34;The Cavern&#34; is not anyone\&#39;s idea of goofy fun. It is unwatchable. (I ran it at x2 the normal speed, just to get it over with, hoping I would actually be able to see something by the end of the film; but when I did, it was just stupid.) This film did provide me with one satisfying moment, though; since it only cost a couple bucks, after I got it out of the DVD player, I was able to smash it with my own hands - what a relief!&#39;
b&#39;weak direction, weak plot, unimpressive music, i wonder why Udita Goswami is there in the movie world in the first place ? she tried to reveal a lot of her talent (mostly skin) but failed to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;music wasn\&#39;t that impressive as well, only one song &#34;Jhalak Dikhlajaa&#34; was worth listening to..... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aksar, the title ? well they tried to justify the title of the movie in the end, but it didn\&#39;t make sense..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there were many unwanted twists and turns in the story, which made it more boring. however if someone\&#39;s a Dino Morea fan, please go ahead and watch it.&#39;
b&#39;If you\&#39;re coming to this film to learn something about depression, forget it: you won\&#39;t learn anything except how not to write a screenplay on the subject. I understand the intent was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I\&#39;ve ever seen in a Hollywood feature... no small feat. Christina Ricci as Elizabeth spends the entirety of this film screaming at the top of her lungs, viciously insulting someone, bursting into tears or some combination of the three (the only exceptions being some quiet sulking at the beginning and end). There is not the slightest hint of what she might be like WITHOUT depression... not the faintest glimmer of any other aspects of her personality... she just screams. At one point, her roommate tells her, &#34;Lizzie, you\&#39;re such a fun person to be around when you\&#39;re not being depressed,&#34; and my reaction was, &#34;She IS?&#34; It seemed odd that the writers would include this comment without giving us any examples, but this script is a lesson in incompetence. It has no discernible structure or flow at all; instead, it consists of a series of awkwardly strung-together scenes of Lizzie screaming, then ends. Character development? No... Scenes of her everyday existence, i.e. going to classes, that might possibly be important details? No... Screaming at maximum volume? CHECK. It\&#39;s not quite enough, I\&#39;m afraid. 1/10.&#39;
b&#39;Every once in a while, an indie comes along that has an awesome cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can\&#39;t-miss, but the movie sucks. Some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are &#34;Levity&#34; and &#34;The Safety Of Objects&#34;, and now here\&#39;s &#34;The United States Of Leland&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said awesome cast includes Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Don Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein, and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays Leland P. Fitzgerald, the teenage son of a famous author (Spacey) who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime (murdering a retarded child), but doesn\&#39;t remember it and doesn\&#39;t seem to have any sort of motive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Cheadle plays a teacher in juvenile hall who is trying to understand Leland (and also exploit him by writing a book about him), and Jena Malone is his ex-girlfriend. We see their deteriorating relationship (due to her heroin addiction) in flashback. Sounds like an awesome little drama, huh? I thought so, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is that this movie is just badly, badly written. The dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and laden with irritating platitudes about &#34;life&#34;, the characters are all two-dimensional indie cliches, and while it does manage to make Leland sympathetic in some ways, it glosses over his crime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, there\&#39;s no problem with the acting. Gosling (who was Oscar-worthy in &#34;The Believer&#34;) is a tremendously talented young actor, but the way they\&#39;re written, none of these characters (least of all Leland) even feel like real people, so there\&#39;s not much he can do but mumble his ridiculous lines and look sad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jena Malone is the most memorable. She has one of the most expressive faces I\&#39;ve ever seen. Even playing an underwritten character in a bad movie like this, she can break your heart with one look. When she\&#39;s got good material to work with (as in &#34;Donnie Darko&#34; or &#34;The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys&#34;), she\&#39;s really amazing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is not good material. Maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been something worthwhile, but as it is, &#34;The United States Of Leland&#34; is ponderous, inert, and for a movie that seems in love with how &#34;deep&#34; it is, it\&#39;s really shallow.&#39;
b&#39;I wish it were &#34;Last Dumb Thriller&#34;. But thrillers are like that. They are like children: numerous, illogical, and often annoying. They want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a child\&#39;s behaviour or a thriller\&#39;s plot? Having seen this particular child - I mean... thriller - I understand why reviewers refer to it as &#34;a hitchcockian thriller&#34;; they might as well have called it &#34;idiotic&#34; for that\&#39;s what &#34;hitchcockian&#34; means in the movie dictionary (look it up, if you don\&#39;t believe me). Even the soundtrack is old-school Hollywood which is a mistake: it doesn\&#39;t fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony. Besides, how dare they steal De Palma\&#39;s idea of stealing from Hitchcock?! The story is absurd. Scheider\&#39;s wife is killed, and her killers are never an issue. Instead, first his former employers follow him around, and later decide to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? No explanation. Perhaps because the FBI is a dark, dark organization (&#34;X-Files&#34;) which is very trigger-happy about knocking off its former employees for pension-funds reasons. Or perhaps because it\&#39;s fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie; everyone seems to be after him. And while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy, in reality the killer is... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman occupying Scheider\&#39;s living quarters; the one that briefly hinted she was &#34;depraved&#34;. Why does she go after Scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid - and followed by his own ex-employers - and not a few years earlier or few years after the wife\&#39;s murder? A pure hitchcockian (look it up again in the dictionary, in case you forgot what it means) coincidence. And how about that brilliant motive of hers...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a fresh-off-the-boat 15 year-old virgin in NY, and then syphilisized by a bunch of horny Jewish men, one of whom - tah-dah! - is Scheider\&#39;s grandfather. As a result, Margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time (among other things) in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilisized her once-virginal grandmother. How hitchcockian (look it up) is that? The finale then shamelessly rips off the Mount Rushmore scene from &#34;North By Northwest&#34;, except that the love-interest is a killer and she doesn\&#39;t get saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie also offers some dubious/off-kilter dialog and some not-so great acting. Check out the silly and obvious way in which Napier follows Scheider at the cemetery. Let\&#39;s also not forget the moronic plot-device of Napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously - but it wasn\&#39;t a gun! How brilliant! Napier in the tower: now, there\&#39;s another string of illogical behavioural patterns. J. Demme was, is, and always will be a director without style, without flair, and the man who directed &#34;Philadelphia&#34;. Let\&#39;s give him another Oscar!&#39;
b&#34;Did the first travesty actually make money? This is another sequel (along the lines of ANOTHER STAKEOUT) that no one asked for. But we&#39;ve received it anyway. The sequel is like its predecessor, completely brain-dead. It&#39;s also pretty disgusting (remember the dinner scene?) To think I almost felt sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck, and Warden. Did they need the money that much?&#34;
b&#34;Yep, this has got to be one of the lamest movies I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s utterly tasteless, has no style whatsoever, the story is so thin that you can watch television through it, and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil tanker through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I appreciate a good B-movie as much as most male white homo sapiens do. But this has got to be the worst I&#39;ve seen. In fact it&#39;s so B that it lacks everything that makes a B-movie interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole movie is based around such charming artefacts as the characters beating the crap out of each other, various bodily functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything on-screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not even funny. In fact it&#39;s quite the opposite. I found it even boring at times due to it&#39;s extreme predictability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find nothing good to say about this movie. It was a waste of time watching it, and I hope others don&#39;t do the same mistake. If you also pay for it you should get a serious brainscan done.&#34;
b&#34;I like vampire movies, I like B-movies, I love B vampire movies. But this one has nearly nothing going for it. Some of the acting is horrible, especially by 3 of the male leads. The story is not particular interesting. At a relative short 88 minutes it still seems too long and you&#39;ll find yourself fast-forwarding quite a bit. There are an awful lot of kung-fu vampire attacks. Sound cool? It isn&#39;t when it&#39;s done on a low budget. It gets repetitive very quickly. There is some minor blood and gore, nothing to get excited about. There some good wire work where you can see the wires. It has some good landscapes being filmed in Puerto Rico. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the rental&#34;
b&#34;A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander), and her boyfriend, Jess (Joey Mendicino) become targets for a deranged serial killer after stopping for a &#39;comfort break&#39; at a remote road-side rest-stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What might have been an effectively scary chiller in more competent hands, turns out to be a confusing, ill-considered mess under the sloppy direction of John Shiban (who also wrote the screenplay). There is a good deal of juicy violence, a brief smattering of nudity, and confident performances from the cast, but the silly script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions one cannot help but feel disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the surface, the film plays out like a standard clich\xc3\xa9-ridden &#39;killer-on-the-loose&#39; movie, but Shiban (an ex-writer for the X-files) throws in some subtle supernatural elements which suggest that his aim was something else entirely: a ghost story, with the rest stop acting as home to a vengeful spectre out to punish sinners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By reading up on the film, checking out viewers&#39; theories here on IMDb, and watching the extras on the DVD, certain plot elements begin to make a little more sense (although, even with the advantage of extra information, there are still many questions left unanswered). In my opinion, any film that requires this much investigation to make itself (only partially) understood is not particularly a good one.&#34;
b&#34;There are many reasons I&#39;m not a fan of fact based films, but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license over the story. If they have such great imaginations then why not use that talent to make something original? Otherwise stick to the facts. This could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that. Ed Gein was an insanely frightening human being. It&#39;s been said if you were to take Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface, wrap them into one person, Ed Gein would still be sicker/scarier. So why can&#39;t someone make a movie about him that can convey this? When will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve read books and watched news programs about him and, now I&#39;m not a screenwriter or anything, but I believe there&#39;s enough documentation on Gein that it shouldn&#39;t take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented. I&#39;m aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and barn there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the deputy&#39;s relationship with his Mother, and girlfriend as filler, and far too much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess what I&#39;m wondering is this... why at the end of the movie did I know more about the supporting characters than I did about Ed Gein? Why didn&#39;t we get to know his Mother, Father and brother and the relationships between them... what made him the psychopath he was... what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became? Instead, the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy... running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I give it 4/10 stars. Thats 2 for the gore and 2 for Kane Hodder. Even though it was kind of bad casting in my opinion, considering Gein was a smallish man, and possibly effeminate and Hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what I would consider feminine. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.&#34;
b&#34;This was not a very good movie, the acting pretty much stunk and the effects were bad most of the time. But there were some funny moments but most of those were not meant to be funny. The most hilarious part of the movie to me was the part were a little kid in wheelchair falls out (thats not the funny part What kind of person do you think I am)anyway the kid falls out and starts screaming for his big brother, well the brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so funny he&#39;s all stumbling and really over acting I had to rewind it several times so I could laugh some more. so if your looking for something to rent but just can&#39;t seem to find anything check this one out and watch for the running part.&#34;
b&#39;Here he is. A new horror icon for the new millennium. Better than Freddy. More dangerous than Jason Vorhees. More evil than Michael Myers. Hard to believe, I know. But his time is here....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray The Prick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, the antagonist, Ray is a complete Prick. This is partly because of the naughty things he does. Also because he has a scar (oh, scary) on his face. But mainly because Ray The Prick has been milked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, Ray doesn\&#39;t channel evil. He doesn\&#39;t even become cursed, not even by a voodoo spell. Nope, Ray The Prick has been milked. As DeNiro once said, &#34;You can milk anything with nipples&#34;. And Ray has been milked. Of evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you milk evil you ask? Snake nipples, I reply. Snake nipples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why Ray you ask? Because he\&#39;s a Prick, I reply. Capital P.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out for the New Line Pictures extravaganza entitled &#34;Freddy Vs. Ray The Prick&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought your new horror saviour was Jeeper The Creeper? Well not any more, cause Ray The Prick is here. And I\&#39;m frightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pity about the atmosphere-less, PG-13, unoriginal workmanlike quality of the film though, because Ray\&#39;s a star.&#39;
b&#34;I saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival, and would not recommend it. It is two and a half hours long, during which nothing much happens at a wading-through-porridge pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main characters are gormless and totally lacking in charisma or personality. No-one smiles at all during the film (neither would I if I had their lives), and although Domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite she doesn&#39;t seem to enjoy sex at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole experience is depressing and ponderous, the director lingering over each scene in a way that drove me crazy rather than striking me with the beauty of his technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many questions were left in my mind: why does he sniff the Algerian man&#39;s head? Why does he levitate? What is he looking at over the allotment fence? Why does he kiss Joseph? Why did we go and see this rubbish rather than ordering another bottle of wine in Bouzy Rouge?&#34;
b&#39;HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974. But the critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of a sense of humor by slamming this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cash-in on the success of American GRAFFITTI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some similarities between American GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both opened with &#34;Rock Around the Clock&#34; by Bill Haley &amp; the Comets. Both took place in a bygone era and both featured Ron Howard as one of the leading roles. But there were also some major differences. While American GRAFFITTI took place in 1962 California and centered around a group of newly graduated high school students about to take that big step into adulthood, HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee, Wisconson and centered around a group of teenagers in high school, dealing with the joys and tribulations of adolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY DAYS originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of Bill Haley &amp; the Comets\&#39; ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK. But when oldies became hot, thanks to the success of American GRAFFITTI, , and the original 1954 version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK, entered the Billboard Hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974, royalty payments went through the roof. So a &#34;remake&#34; of the song (the correct term is now &#34;new stereo recording&#34;) was quickly substituted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current theme song for HAPPY DAYS was then introduced for the second season if memory serves me right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans and foes alike agree that this show is escapist. Liberties were taken and details overlooked, making this show less than completely authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfectly fine. HAPPY DAYS is supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. But occasionally the writers did sometimes stick their necks out by hitting on controversial topics. One episode centered around the Cunninghams building of a fall out shelter. Another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life. The topic of prejudice was addressed when Howard was invited to the wedding of an old army buddy who just happened to be black (in an era when prejudice and discrimination was sadly an acceptable part of the American way of life). The issue of the draft even came up on a later episode!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show as originally set in 1955. One problem that was dealt wisely was with the cast. Most of them were teenagers and as each year passed, it was obvious that they grew older so the series aged with the cast, moving the series out of the safe waters of the Eisenhower years into the Age of Camelot, all the way with JFK and then into the turbulent later half of the 1960s. That, along with the writers running out of ideas, and later, cast members like Ron Howard leaving the series, wisely quitting while they were ahead, left me wishing that they had all done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and quitting while they were ahead. That, along with the idol worshiping studio audience who just couldn\&#39;t control themselves every time the Great Fonzie entered the scene, began to wear very thin very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show originally portrayed the Fabulous Fifties as we LIKE to remember that era. Time heals wounds, you know. Everything has its place and though I would prefer hearing the &#34;original hit versions&#34; over those &#34;new stereo recordings&#34;, those &#34;new stereo recordings&#34; worked very well on HAPPY DAYS. And this is where I find myself regretting my buying the DVD! Unlike the complete first season DVD, the original music on the complete second season, has been replaced with different music. While it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection, the removal of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show so much fun to watch!&#39;
b&#39;I accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels. I immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast, &#34;groovy&#34; haircuts aside, and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars? Having not seen the original, I guessed it might be the Poseidon Adventure, since it was obviously on a ship in distress. Was I wrong! I cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash. There is no story, the performances all looked forced, the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event, and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as Sally Field, Michael Caine, et al. They must have needed the money badly. Can we blame the director?&#39;
b&#34;All of the great horror movies of the 70&#39;s, 80&#39;s, and even the early 90&#39;s from Psycho, to Texas Chainsaw Masacre (The original not that warmed over WB crap), to Silence of the Lambs. The characters in these movies were based upon the crimes of Ed Gein. The writers and directors tapped into the true story for the inspiration for creating some of the greatest *fictional* movie killers of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old horror films were great because even though the crimes were loosely based upon the facts of the case of Ed Gein, they were truly fictional and far removed from the true story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the case of this movie, they&#39;ve created a fictional horror film in which they tried to capitalize on the true story in order to sell a cheap, poorly acted, love story between two characters that nobody really cares about. In fact, in a *good* horror film these two characters would have been excellent victims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of Lecture...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this film was like wearing clammy underwear on a cold afternoon sipping on a nice cup of chilled vomit.&#34;
b&#39;A wildly uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller. To me, the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one, and they should have gone for an all-out comedy. For example, Rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy. The scene where Betty\&#39;s husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy. An even better example is the Hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through Freeman\&#39;s character, early on, about the plight of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They should have given Freeman something funny to say in that segment, but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring PC speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is yet more New Age PC-ness in the form of the ending: the girl not only doesn\&#39;t get the boy - she gets no boy at all; in fact, the message is that the girl needs no boy at all! Bit of a feminist statement there. The first half-hour is weak, but the movie gets better - ironically - once Zellweger gets to Kinnear. I say &#34;ironically&#34; because I\&#39;m not much of a fan of Kinnear\&#39;s, though he\&#39;s solid here. Zellweger is very cute, as usual; she has the sort of all-American cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy, and I have to wonder why more of such women aren\&#39;t &#34;represented&#34; nowadays, instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars, such as Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez, or Barrymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the movie tries to be very serious at times, I have no choice but to criticize Freeman\&#39;s character which is the gangster\&#39;s equivalent of the movie world\&#39;s hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold. There is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son.&#39;
b&#34;No matter what other people have said you can&#39;t review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on it&#39;s own it would be a 2-3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. If the film was a re-working or, as in Planet of the Apes, a re-imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it&#39;s own right, only referencing the original. Imagine it this way, if someone took the model in the &#39;Mona Lisa&#39;, posed her in a different way, and painted her you could only compare the framing,concept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said this film doesn&#39;t just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly, like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made, the shower scene will never be forgotten, the remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and his master work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The degrading aspects of this picture were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It&#39;s nothing to do with wether they acted better or not it&#39;s that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent, Norman didn&#39;t really understand sex, he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful Marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he doesn&#39;t really understand sex and his attraction to her,this makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero, you are on his side because he doesn&#39;t fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his &#39;Mother&#39;. In the remake that whole dynamic is gone, I must admit to Janet Leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that, Anne Heche is really unattractive and so Norman finding &#39;her&#39; Marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to Vince Vaughn&#39;s Norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a Norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like, who you feel absolutely no sympathy for, they further destroy Norman&#39;s innocent nature by putting the porno mags in his room. It destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for, it&#39;s like re-making &#39;It&#39;s a wonderful life&#39; and having the main character a pimp, totally degrading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other character that I had problems with was Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion&#39;s workmate. In the original when Pat Hitchcock says the line &#39;he must have noticed my wedding ring&#39; it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself, when Rita says it it just seems plausible as there really isn&#39;t any other reason why any man would flirt with Anne Heche over her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll admit that I am very biased, the original &#39;Psycho&#39; is my favorite film of all time, had the film been a reworking, with a different angle, then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hitch famously thaught the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it. This also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it&#39;s own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are de-sensetising the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour. (n.b before people think &#39;he can&#39;t spell&#39; remember I&#39;m from England and we spell it colour)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A remake should be just that, re made, this is a forgery, a complete copy and a very bad one at that. I could go on comparing but there is no point, almost everything is superior in the original. The only one thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called him &#39;The Stiff&#39; behind his back) and Mortensen gives a more believable if less likeable performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors that hold up to the originals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a movie that should be labeled &#39;Expensive Embarrassing Failed Experiment. Only view if comparing to original or if original is unknown to you. But view original too&#39; The movie would have got a 3 out of 5 if it were original or a reworking but as it is 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)&#34;
b&#39;I saw the first House of the Dead and expected a root canal to be more pleasant to attend, so when it wasn\&#39;t as bad as that, I was delightfully surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as well...and I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently I\&#39;m one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw, or wonder if I saw the wrong movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra \&#39;Nightingale\&#39; Morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them. They deserve to be in better movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects were okay and some of the characters likable/hate-able and that made for a tolerable watch, but for the most part, this movie was just a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I have to ask this because I found myself asking it aloud ALL the way through the movie...did anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldn\&#39;t just wander into the rooms? Only once did it happen, (zombies wandering in) and I found that a little convenient...soldiers walk into a room, leave the door wide open, pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it (with the hapless &#34;livings&#34; being cornered with no way to escape) and yet only once did zombies follow them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nitpicky? Maybe but honestly...if I was fighting for my life, the last thing I\&#39;d do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could swarm in and eat me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is really the only thing *bothered* me throughout the movie, and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally abominable original.&#39;
b&#34;If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G then Ali G is immeasurably better. I&#39;ts no master piece, but it&#39;s a film at least. Borat is complete garbage and I do not understand how it rated better then Ali G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot put my finger on it, there something wrong with the Ali G script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old, not by an adult scriptwriter. And a number of jokes including Mr Cohen&#39;s lower body are quite tasteless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how Ali G becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in today&#39;s western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), also Ali&#39;s advice about immigrant policy and some others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali G overall remains a sympathetic character, even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it&#39;s OK to watch,it&#39;s quite funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But never ever watch Borat, it&#39;s awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick.&#34;
b&#39;Director Nico Mastorakis has made a cynical cash-grabber (by his own admission) that is too cynical to impress anybody but a sophomore genre fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most extreme, confronting genre pics, to paraphrase a character in VIDEODROME, &#34;have a philosophy&#34;; that is what makes them dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ISLAND OF DEATH\&#39;s philosophy is to throw many &#34;shocking&#34; elements into a cinematic mix and stir slowly. The result is a dish with no taste but an ugly appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be confused with Serrador\&#39;s brilliant WHO COULD KILL A CHILD? (sometimes called ISLAND OF DEATH), Mastorakis\&#39;s effort is set on a Greek island which is a stage for various forms of slaughter, a little bestiality and some wholesale perversion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything moves at a snailish pace and the violent set pieces are poorly directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touted as &#34;The movie that the censors didn\&#39;t want you to see&#34;, I\&#39;d hazard a guess that the censors never saw it, they simply read the presskit until their knees jerked upwards.&#39;
b&#34;This movie was disturbing, not because of the subject matter but because of the way it was handled. The extremely overweight mother (Angela) did not even make it on the cover of the video case when most of the rest of the cast did. This is not fair but is a statement in itself. I also notice her picture is missing from IMDb (maybe her own choice) and it looks like this is her only film ever? The language in this movie was crude beyond necessity. Watched with my 10yr old son because it was rated PG in Canada and the language coming out of their mouths was shameful &amp; disgusting. Never did appreciate Shirley Maclain like so many others seem to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE Kathy Bates and always will. Sinese&#39;s part was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little boy Alex is a great little actor. I&#39;ll have to see what else he&#39;s been up to lately..&#34;
b&#34;This is the most stupid movie ever made. The story is laughable. His wife and kid think he&#39;s insane. Then they don&#39;t. Then it turns out he is and I think they knew it all along. There is a dog named Ned that causes some problems and I think it&#39;s all his fault...so does Jim Carey. God only knows why Virginia Madsen took this role...this is a career sinker. I think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 year olds. And that adds up to 23. Or maybe it&#39;s for 8 and 10 years olds which also adds up to 23. Or maybe it&#39;s for really dumb 23 year olds. Or maybe really dumb 32 year olds because that&#39;s 23 in reverse. Or maybe 46 year olds would enjoy it because half of that is 23. I think looking up things on the internet about the number 23 would be more entertaining than this movie, unless you wanted to see a comedy.&#34;
b&#39;OK I was bought this a few Xmas\&#39; ago by my brother in law, who took me to see &#34;Get Shorty&#34; in the cinema, which the both of use were &#34;uber&#34; impressed with. And watched both get shorty and be cool one after another. I have read reviews of people that had not seen get shorty and thought this film was quite good.... I just think its another way for film companies to cheat the paying customer. All I have to say about this film is WTF? After nearly 10 years and Chili Palmer had become a pussy.... The script was basically the same, they teamed up Travolta and Thurman after their success of Plup Fiction, threw in a couple of big stars(plus a shed load of nobodies) and thought that it was going to be good..... Vince Vaughn\&#39;s character was just annoying, despite me being a fan of both him and the Rock both of the actors were way under utilised and unrealistic. Basically I am glad that this was bought for me as a present as if I had paid money for it I would have been super annoyed.&#39;
b&#34;I didn&#39;t watch this show that much when I was little. And I think I only watched 1 episode which was about Railroads I believe because I liked trains and still do. Even then I thought it was a baby show. I mostly watched Arthur. The songs are pretty weird too. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that educational either. They just sing some dumb Nursery Rhymes. This is a dumb show, any adults who like it are crazy! If you want some good kids shows, watch something like Arthur, Mister Rogers Neighborhood or even better Pee-wee&#39;s Playhouse. I thought Sesame Street was boring when I was little but even that is better than Barney. Trust me, this show is pretty dumb, there are other Kids Shows that are better than this one. I can see many of the reviews here that a lot of people don&#39;t like this show. Now there are some mature people. I hope they take this show off air soon.&#34;
b&#34;I&#39;ve got as much testosterone as the next bloke, and Raquel Welch at her finest is certainly worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cut-out could act better, and an hour and half of Ms. W showing off her considerable assets does not a movie make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cast, it&#39;s surprising that it&#39;s as bad as it is. I&#39;ve never been a big fan of Wagner, and his tough guy Harry is about as convincing as a 9-dollar bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, both of whom I usually enjoy, seem to be sleeping through their lines; and as for Edward G...well, I can only assume he was there for the paycheck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is a mess: from non-existent plot, through stop-start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60&#39;s &#39;caper&#39; music. If it weren&#39;t for Miss Welch, I&#39;d have given it a 0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, she is a treat to the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in &#39;Bedazzled&#39; - and for that reason alone I gave it a 3.&#34;
b&#34;In the past 5 years I have rented some bad movies...completely on purpose. See I aspire to be a movie reviewer, and as we all know there are horrible movies released every year. Anyway, about 3 months ago I rented this one. I watched it all the way through...and cried profusely. This is one of those movies that is so freakin bad it makes you want to puke. It actually put a sick feeling in my stomach. I&#39;ve seen lots of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000 anyone?) but this one takes the cake. The plot was hard to follow, the lighting horrible and the sounds almost inaudible. If there was a negative rating on the scale here this movie would be at -11 for me. This may seem odd, but I highly recommend it. It&#39;s something you have to see for yourself...but don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you. I don&#39;t think this review could get any more precise so I&#39;m done now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#34;The director has no clue. I know ... That is the obvious comment. Maybe, we should delve into the story ... the relationships ... how about the quality of the actors?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is ... well, idiotic would be a simple yet honest answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors are ... they tried very hard. Can they be faulted for the director&#39;s choices?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why was this made? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, isn&#39;t this an embarrassment to the Korean-American film industry? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should we be selective about who we support? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I being too harsh? Check it out for yourself.&#34;
b&#39;Usually, any movie with Steve Railsback in the lead is a good movie. However, this movie does not conform to that opinion. Lifeforce is a below average movie that is extremely confusing in the beginning (reminds me of Star Trek: TMP), but is able to pick things up a bit towards the end when London becomes Zombie City. A horror/sci-fi mess that is very hard to sit through, although the naked spacegirl/vampire is very easy to look at. This movie deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.&#39;
b&#34;There&#39;s no use trying to describe in detail the convoluted, overly melodramatic plot involving Civil War bitterness, a crooked town boss, and other complications. It&#39;s all bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Stevens, Andrew Prine, Bo Svenson, William Smith, Tim Thomerson and Lee Majors are all good actors that may not be big stars (or big stars anymore) but always made fun movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, they&#39;re all wasted on a picture that looks like it was shot in a wild west tourist trap, with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater department. In fact, most of the acting appears to be on the high school level too, which might not be so bad if it weren&#39;t so pretentious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of Ed Wood is invoked way too lightly these days. I think in this case the comparison is warranted. However, I suspect that old Ed would have made a more entertaining western than this.&#34;
b&#39;I won\&#39;t be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then, things got worse. The concept is nothing special, just about a girl named Casey who is trying to cope with a new step-brother, Derek, and his loud, crude family, while she gradually forces her princess standards onto each of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In season 1, the story was actually interesting. I liked Casey back then because she was smart, strong, independent, and conservative. She was well-mannered and deep. I felt bad when she was being harassed at her new school by her new step-brother. She was a perfectionist, but not as annoying as the later episodes. Oh, and she dated a nice guy, who is now currently portrayed as one of Derek\&#39;s idiot friends. The season grasped the true tension the title of the show was trying to capture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can\&#39;t say the show has really gone downhill because the story is sometimes interesting, but I root for Derek now instead of Casey. Now, there is little, if any interaction, between the two siblings. If they interact, it\&#39;s only briefly. Oh, and I don\&#39;t want any Dasey fans in my face. People, that\&#39;s called INCEST, even if they are step-siblings. My tolerance can only go so far, but that\&#39;s not the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s strange. Derek, as the antagonist, has gotten more sensitive over time, while Casey, the supposed protagonist, is more neurotic and unlikeable than before. I like how the younger kids get more airtime, but the parents are even more clueless than before. But that\&#39;s not the biggest problem...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, we are forced to see everything from Casey\&#39;s point of view, with lame, nauseating background music. She has gotten stupider and more shallow over time. In one episode, she got whiny and wanted her boyfriend to be more chivalrous, so she purposely dumped food on herself and blamed Derek. Now, what happened to being a strong, independent feminist? I haven\&#39;t watched much of the fourth season, but I hear she is dating a guy named Truman, who is a jackass and is arrogant. Oh, I remember that fencing episode. She constantly reminds him she doesn\&#39;t like him, freaks out over being &#34;goosed&#34; by a sword, and in the end, hooks up with him because she can &#34;handle&#34; him? What the hell? Why go with a guy like that in the first place. The 1st season Casey would have just punched him in his...never mind. Or, maybe that would have been my reaction. Oh, and she\&#39;s a cheerleader. Not that that\&#39;s a bad thing, but I think she fell on her head at one of her practices. And in a prom episode, she cried because she couldn\&#39;t find the &#34;dress in her dreams,&#34; and wasn\&#39;t completely satisfied until she became prom queen. One thing I\&#39;ve noticed is that no matter how bad Casey tries to tell us her life is, thing\&#39;s almost always go her way in the end (she gets the guy she wants, Derek gets some kind of revenge, people all love her, etc.) Derek is still quite immature, but I see that he really has matured. I don\&#39;t see why many people hate Sally. She seems nice, and it\&#39;s good to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about rather than &#34;playing the field.&#34; He is also treating Edwin slightly better, and is a good brother to Marti.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the show is so-so, and I rated it low because despite some character development, the character I once admired has now become like any &#34;fashionable teen queen&#34; you can see anywhere on TV. But it was good while it lasted.&#39;
b&#39;I know it\&#39;s not original, but what the hey? What else can be said about it? I feel unutterably silly just paying any attention at all to &#34;From Hell It Came&#34;. The movie makes the important political and social issue of fallout from atmospheric atomic tests seem a matter for joking and dismissal, not the concern and alarm being raised by scientists all over the world at the time.&#39;
b&#34;Do you know that they want to escavate the Moon for real?And in Geneve there is the debated project that could lead to make possible time machine?All i can say about this movie that is based on facts about future(at the time of the movie)scientifical projects but real. Hope the moon will exist not happen as in the movie. Now about the movie itself, I saw the original movie too, and I also read the book. The book I didn&#39;t like though, but the movie yes.I totally agree with a previous comment that this movie was depressing,unlike the 60&#39;s one.That was very good with force, this one was only a paralled future of what is good movie.&#34;
b&#34;Director/screenwriter Allan Burns seems to have patched two different scripts together before coming up with this minor outing: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. It results in a wincingly unfunny film. Christine Lahti plays a crass, cynical TV news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor Mary Tyler Moore and is soon having dinner with Moore and her family--only to discover Mary&#39;s husband (Ted Danson) is Lahti&#39;s secret affair! Burns has a strange, stop-and-start rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective (just increasingly annoying, because nothing important ever seems to get said). Rail-thin Moore, looking alarmingly frail in her leotard, has a radiant smile but doesn&#39;t convince as Danson&#39;s wife, and Danson gets stuck with a paltry, thankless role (he&#39;s just there to be a cad). The movie attempts to cover all the bases in a classic case of overreaching (woman&#39;s role in the workplace, the TV news-biz, the cheating family man, the working wife and mother who wants more, a woman&#39;s need for female friendships, et al), but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since Burns only half-heartedly examines the issues. As a writer, he is surprisingly free of punchlines, but is devoid of a purpose as well, and the heavy plotting just gets all fouled up. *1/2 from ****&#34;
b&#34;With Knightly and O&#39;Tool as the leads, this film had good possibilities, and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants. It was of course totally superficial, beautiful English country and seaside or not.The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film, when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part. They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast, and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements.&#34;
b&#39;As you might not know E\xc3\xa7a de Queiroz is one of Portugal\&#39;s most rightfully celebrated writers. He was witty, he spared no one in his critics and must now be rolling in his tomb. And that\&#39;s not due to this movie being bad, which it is, but as a result of the treatment dispensed to one of his masterworks &#34;O Crime do Padre Amaro&#34;. It\&#39;s treated like cheap, throwaway trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was publicized that this was to be a &#34;modern and urban&#34; take on the book I feared for the worst, normally modern in these contexts means taking the liberty to take the p**** when doing an adaptation, to half arse it in the shoddiest possible way. And so the moral and social dilemma of a priest having a secret,forbidden affair are substituted by extra-long passages of people dealing drugs and singing hip-hop for no particular or pertinent reason to the plot. It\&#39;s just there like it might very well not have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and there\&#39;s lots of sex so you can at least be counting on that when you put this on. Remember how every movie in the 80\&#39;s, no matter the genre or the tone always found a way to sneak in some nudity? If it was a thriller and they had no need for it they simply found a way that when they were capturing a felon he &#34;happened&#34; to be in bed with a woman that would prance around screaming (naked of course) when the cops barged in. Ahem, gratuitous is the word I think. Not that there\&#39;s anything wrong with nude scenes but here they make the creators of this movie look desperate simply because there\&#39;s nothing else to the movie, it\&#39;s totally devoid of what do you call it dramatic content.&#39;
b&#39;Hello people,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe that &#34;Shades&#34; from That Thing You Do took this role. I don\&#39;t think Cory Feldman would have taken this role. This movie was a fuming pile of dung. Save your money and time, and see every one of the top 250. I swear I wanted to slap the lady at Blockbuster silly for permitting me to rent this. Stay away!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Hipp&#39;
b&#34;You may not believe this, but when the credits to this movie rolled, I looked for the director&#39;s name. When I saw it, I burned it into my memory and I never forgot it. This movie is beyond terrible. It makes Ed Wood&#39;s films look like Orsen Welles. At least B movies are entertaining, this was a soul deadening experience. The quality was so bad, I began to wonder who allowed this to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear Uwe Boll runs fourteen miles a day. This is because wherever his movies are viewed, the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork. The script was terrible, the lighting was like that of a high school football game, and the cinematography was just above the quality of Roger Patterson&#39;s Bigfoot video. The acting was executed by people too ashamed of the production to say their lines with any credibility. In the end was a film Alan Smithee wouldn&#39;t have put his name on. I learned that day to avoid any movie by this man despite the circumstances. From what I hear, this is not a bad thing to do.&#34;
b&#39;The success of the original French &#34;Emmanuelle&#34; series (I\&#39;ve only watched the first, which wasn\&#39;t too bad considering) led to a spate of imitations; the Italian counterpart, which even changed the race of its heroine, was clearly less polished and more exploitative - descending more and more into vulgarity as the series went along. Incredibly, there were 16 &#34;Black Emanuelle&#34; films in total, with the heroine even having the spelling of her name changed to avoid copyright issues!! Still, Laura Gemser - the titular object of desire - became almost as much of an icon as the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (although, personally, she\&#39;s too skinny for my tastes)! Here she\&#39;s even billed as &#34;Emanuelle&#34; rather than with her real name - with the director, likewise, becoming &#34;Albert Thomas&#34;! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In itself, the film offers little of interest: as a matter of fact, one would do best to approach it as a travelogue with some decent footage of the African wildlife. With respect to the sex scenes, I don\&#39;t know how complete the version I watched was but, while there was a lot of nudity, none of it was very explicit - or even titillating (the scene that came closest, perhaps, was when Gemser - who works as a photographer - and her companion Karin Schubert turn the camera on each other, naturally sans clothes, in the middle of the jungle)! The film also features an artist made up to look like Salvador Dali but, mercifully perhaps, his scenes do not take much of the running time. The score by Nico Fidenco is typically bland 70s pop and, really, nothing to write home about.&#39;
b&#34;Ramsay \xc2\x96 the kings of comedy (or was it horror, whatever) wake after years of hibernation. And yes, I did get scared. No not because of the horror element (of course I am not that squeamish) but because rats were constantly dancing on my feet in the khatmal-chaap theatre (where else do such movies run).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So check the plot. A man is repeatedly stabbed, choked to death, stuffed in plastic and dumped in a pool. But he still returns to take revenge. Now was the film a thriller or a horror? That itself is the suspense for you to discover. And the end turns out to be another mask mystery. Remember those trademark Ramsay undercover agents \xc2\x96 men wearing some stupid horror masks. Only here the mask is of a human. I suppose, no more detailing is required to skip this flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amarr Upadhyay tends to get over-dramatic and theatrical, forgetting the difference between cinema and TV soaps. A cheaply and skimpily dressed Aditi Gowitrikar in her typical pink lipstick looks like \xc2\x85.. (Uh! you know what).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The background score is a straight lift from Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s Psycho. Not a single department of the film, whether technical or creative, is worth commenting. Novelty lacks both in story and execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dhund certainly fogs your senses.&#34;
b&#34;Don&#39;t get fooled by the &#39;awards&#39; and the comment below. This is just 1 poor movie. The way George Katt played his character (the soft gangster) makes it very annoying to watch. The conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic display of this. De in the rest of the film the character&#39;s head seems to be somewhere else. His emotions don&#39;t match with the things that happen in the film.The things he says as a voice-over doesn&#39;t add anything to the film. It just makes Zeus an even more spineless character with is head in the clouds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story and the film was put together with a total lack of fantasy. All parts of the film were poorly stolen from other modern directors. Let&#39;s hope Jon Rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.&#34;
b&#39;Even those of us who like cute animal pictures --- and I abhor them ---would be hard pressed to find any merit in this abysmally bad travesty of a film. Perhaps inspired by &#34;101 Dalmatians&#34; with its smart and loyal dogs, its dumb and devious humans and its absurdly &#34;happy&#34; and predictable ending, the alternate title &#34;101 Turkeys&#34; springs to mind. That would just about cover everyone involved in its unfortunate production. I dismissed it as some inane Hollywood perversion of British customs before learning, to my horror, that it actually is a Canadian film, done in Victoria BC, that phony British theme park of a town, while sucking tax dollars out of Ottawa ON, that equally phony pit of Canadian mediocrity. Let me count the ways it is bad. The dizzy plot? The asinine script? The dismal performances and sophomoric direction? The cloyingly clever animals? The endless clich\xc3\xa9s and predictable slapstick? On second thought, neither I nor those browsing the IMDb have time for a complete catalogue of its failings. Yet were I to detail its merits, this space would remain blank. Trust me, it is bad; a signal monument in the vast pantheon of truly terrible (Canadian) cinema. If you have seen it already, my condolences. If you have not, stay away from it as you would SARS or bubonic plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Don\&#39;t even let your children see it lest their tiny minds be warped by the even tinier minds of those who financed, fabricated and filmed this frightful folly. Perhaps tonight, when I retire, I will have a nightmare with ghastly fanged beasts springing from the bed table as I flee in frantic flight. I hope so. It will be a far far better thing I do than watch this beastly banal boondoggle. But then, I might dream that I had to watch it a second time and the sheer terror and cold sweat of that makes me want to stay up all night, trembling at the very possibility of seeing it again even as a bad dream. I might even find something worthwhile to watch in its stead. Maybe &#34;Godzilla&#34; or &#34;Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes&#34; Perhaps the instruction video for my built in vacuum cleaner.&#39;
b&#34;....is where I&#39;m assuming this movie came from. I mean, I&#39;ve watched plenty of B movies over the course of my young life so far, and I wouldn&#39;t even classify this as a B movie. I remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that surpass this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the premise is...a bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens. Women in bikinis, who aren&#39;t even that great looking to begin with, dance in the beginning and sing. Guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight. I mean, I can barely put together a cohesive sentence just thinking about this movie. According to most people on this site, Manos the Hands of Fate and Pod People are the worst movies (MST3K classics :-D)...I used to be one of them. Then I saw this movie. Usually I don&#39;t try to trash a movie too much, but the people who made this really do deserve it. It is THAT bad and THAT unbearable, and I&#39;m assuming the director or an actor in the movie is the only person who rated this a ten.&#34;
b&#39;This could have been a good TV-movie, but the flashbacks do not make it easier to understand the movie. As they give the viewer informations on the way (will the movie proceeds) i found myself wondering why she never said or mentioned that in the beginning. Then the whole trail would probably not have been necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the movie ends you understand why she shot, and of course she is not guilty. Too bad that the producer/director used the flashbacks this way, but on the other had the movie would not have been worth while at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice movie for a rainy day, big bag of chips to kill the evening.&#39;
b&#39;Who the heck had the &#34;bright&#34;(?) idea of casting Lucille Ball in this film??? It should have been Angela Lansbury\&#39;s baby all the way. At the very least Lucy should have had her singing dubbed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some compensation in the fact that Jerry Herman\&#39;s score is pretty well kept intact except for &#34;That\&#39;s How Young I Feel&#34;, and we do get performances by the original Broadway cast members Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose Robert Preston had to be given a song, hence the inferior &#34;Loving You&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think in this one the wrong redhead was cast.&#39;
b&#39;I did my best to watch this two hour fiasco. It combined the awful special effects and plot of the original &#34;Blob,&#34; with an execrable boosting of the (outstanding in the original) screenplay of &#34;Runaway Train.&#34; The only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and figured they\&#39;d combine it with a shot at hosting a casting couch. What an incredible stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part, no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as a typecast creep, a U.S. Senator from Texas and plays it well. He should next do the lead role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the Fay Wray Memorial screaming contest. Special effects are unbelievably bad. H.S. kids in film class in North Dakota could have done a better job. The writers must have pulled a heist at the clich\xc3\xa9 bank to accumulate this many. I couldn\&#39;t watch any more without being forced to sit in the Clockwork Orange chair. I have no idea how it ended, except obviously, 119 minutes too late. Ugh! Caveat emptor.&#39;
b&#34;this show just sucks. i don&#39;t think i even need to say it or why because judging by the number of comments already i am just repeating everything. keys to the vip is like turning on your TV and having it throw poo at you. that is exactly what it is like i am not even exaggerating even a little bit. these guys are so stupid, not funny and not smooth with the ladies that it&#39;s not even funny-casue-its-stupid. i sat through four episodes and i want my two hours back. where do they find the contestants because they are obviously deficient mentally. if i was the man who came up with this idea for a show and put it on TV i would do the world a favour and jump off the tallest building i could find. how does garbage like this get on TV? especially the comedy network shouldn&#39;t a show on something called the comedy network at least be a comedy show or maybe be funny so often?&#34;
b&#34;Not having any idea what this film was about, but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing in it, we decided to watch it. Well, it turned out not to be the wisest decision. In fact, as another commentary in this forum puts it, we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the film is by no means horrible, it doesn&#39;t make sense at all. The over the top performance by William Baldwin doesn&#39;t help the situation either. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better. The basic problem it seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy and the people in charge ran out of ideas along the way. The result is an uneven film.&#34;
b&#39;This is another of Hollywood\&#39;s anti-communist polemics of the golden 1950s. Stalwart American Gene Barry, lovely Englishwoman Valerie French, and three others are kidnapped by an alien and given clamshells containing fantastic--and fantastically vague--power. What will the Earthlings do with such power? Toss it in the sea or use it to wipe out all of mankind? Anybody who knows American cinema circa 1957 knows the answer to what the commies will do, but the story gets ripe when the Americans actually test the things in the middle of the Pacific. Then one scientist, alone with the ultimate power in the universe, comes up with his own theory and uses it! His smarmy attitude afterward is nauseating, and the cheery disposition of everyone else is appalling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here\&#39;s the spoiler for this dog: the capsules inside the clamshells have a mathematical code that tells the prof that they kill only &#34;confirmed enemies of freedom&#34;! That\&#39;s right--don\&#39;t worry about the ethical conundrum of killing everyone that an alien pill decides is an enemy of freedom; just do it! Hurray! No commies! Silly female--and you threw yours into the sea! Ha ha! Kiss me, baby!&#39;
b&#39;This was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen. the acting was god awful, the story line also was bad. it was however a good idea. if this movie would have had better cinematics, and a lot better actors, i might of had something better to say. edgar allen poe was a great Gothic writer, and this movie just destroyed it. why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies. the only good part was when the killer put the head under the floor with a tape going, that was pretty good. the swinging axe was just horrible, there was absolutely no suspense. and also when the killer is chasing everyone around in the end, he was going from one place to another in just seconds, it makes absolutely no sense.&#39;
b&#39;Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this movie was badly written. First of all, during the hijack scene, Irons sits too comfortably in his chair...he appears to be READING something, and rather calmly too! Perhaps the director shot the actor in between takes? Also, the violence at the hijacking was a big letdown. Slow-mo, bullets flying--how his wife and daughter get killed is just not that interesting and the tension is lost. His grieving afterward wasted another 10 minutes. Then he decided to &#34;get revenge&#34; and talk to all his industry journalist friends and ambassadors (he\&#39;s a journalist for the stuffy Economist rag) and lo and behold, they actually give him tips on where to find the bad guys! How do they know? But what really made me turn the movie off halfway through was when Irons finds his way into a warehouse where baddies are hanging out--BUT NOT THE BADDIES WHO KILLED HIS WIFE--and blows them away anyway. so he\&#39;s just a murderer. he gets away and, well...I shut it off. I mean I couldn\&#39;t figure out how his friends knew anything, and also I thought he was after the remaining 2 guys in custody who were the original hijackers. Instead he\&#39;s going after their friends, I guess, or anyone who hangs out in warehouses and leaves automatic weapons laying around. The suspense was just totally conventional and the dialog was lame (&#34;it\&#39;s OK son, crying helps,&#34; he says to his son. Son says &#34;no it doesn\&#39;t&#34; and father says &#34;You\&#39;re right..it doesn\&#39;t.&#34;)Irons takes on questionable roles--like that one dragon movie he did. He was excellent in Brideshead Revisited, which is a completely different animal than this lukewarm thriller.&#39;
b&#34;This is easily one of the worst movies I&#39;ve seen in a long long time (and I&#39;ve recently seen Starship Troopers 2!!!). I could find nothing to redeem this film. The acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen hams it up in his standard character persona. Denis Hopper doesn&#39;t seem to know what he&#39;s supposed to be. Vinnie Jones accent is bizarre. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. Her acting is pretty poor but I doubt that&#39;s why shes there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue is truly appalling. It is quite simply rubbish. I don&#39;t know who signed off on this but they really need to get professional help next time round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is the reason IMDBs rating system should be able to include zero stars out of ten. Avoid at all costs.&#34;
b&#39;Shame to see an interesting story diluted into standard &#34;Vietnam made for TV&#34; fare. Usually HBO movies are a substantial cut above TV. Bill Paxton was a pretty good choice for the lead role, but wasn\&#39;t given much to work with.&#39;
b&#34;I have just given a 10 for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons one to prove I&#39;m not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know pretty Woman is a chick flick but you can&#39;t avoid them all, they&#39;ll eventually get you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we&#39;re talking about here, has a great life, she&#39;s healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this &#39;happy Hooker&#39; type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don&#39;t want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, &#39;Pretty Woman&#39; insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this &#39;lady&#39; that is without his plastic friend, yep don&#39;t leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it&#39;s the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where&#39;s the charm? where&#39;s the charisma, don&#39;t mention that attempt at the piano please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don&#39;t either so it wont have registered. More importantly anyone who likes this film will hate &#39;Thieves Highway&#39; a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll finish on a song:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty woman hangin round the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to treat Pretty woman, I don&#39;t believe you You&#39;re not the truth No one could spend as much as you Mercy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty woman, wont you pardon me Pretty woman, I couldn&#39;t help but see Pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty woman, shop a while Pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, sell your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you&#39;ll stay with me..and I&#39;ll pay you..I&#39;ll treat you right&#34;
b&#34;No one expects the Star Trek movies to be high art, but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this movie had a muddled, implausible plot that just left me cringing - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. Even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can&#39;t save this movie - including the goofy scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy at Yosemite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this movie is not worth a rental, and hardly worth watching, however for the True Fan who needs to see all the movies, renting this movie is about the only way you&#39;ll see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie.&#34;
b&#34;Just how bad? Well, compared to this movie, Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane. There&#39;s the stilted acting, the atrocious dialogue, the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done. Unlike Holocaust, Ferox is a straight forward movie. It doesn&#39;t pretend to be a pseudo documentary. In some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to Holocaust&#39;s graininess. Unfortunately, we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible. They torture the natives and essentially bring everything that they get upon themselves. There&#39;s really nothing in this film that makes it worth your while. I was fairly lenient with my review of Holocaust due to some actual attempt at a statement and style, but in Ferox&#39;s case there is no reason to watch this unless you solely get off on blood and gore.&#34;
b&#34;Rigoletto is Verdi&#39;s masterpiece, full of drama, emotion and powerful, memorable music. The maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but principalled Gilda as a horny ditz. Opera certainly can be adapted to cinema --- look at Zeferelli&#39;s magnificent La Traviata --- but when a work is as superb as Rigoletto, it doesn&#39;t need cheap gimmicks. It might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that.&#34;
b&#39;Evil Behind You, was created for a specific purpose in mind, to shove the writer/directors personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil. Sadly it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took it\&#39;s power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewer.The way its message is presented Almost reminds me of the stories I\&#39;ve heard of the Spanish inquisition! From one real Christian to another, Avoid this like the plague, fear tactics never work when trying to send this kind of message!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting was horrible,the selection of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair(they\&#39;re terrorists so they must be Muslims). The premise of this was good, the story provided a great conduit for its message, however it was the execution of these ideas that fell short making it very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You\&#39;d be better off dusting off your old &#34;Ghost&#34; DVD with Mr Swayze to better receive this message. at least that movie didn\&#39;t try to shove itself down your throat. Or if you like Good Christian movies with a powerful message, try &#34;End of the Spear&#34;&#39;
b&#39;Maximum risk is quite surprising to a person that has seen more then on of his movies. Director Ringo Lam made an average action-movie, that can be compared with most of the other mid-quality action movies, what is a special predicate to a `Muscles from Brussels`movie. It has a quite classy style, an interesting atmosphere and, last but not least, the beautyful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme doesn\xc2\xb4t make you crying by his acting, he does a relatively good job. Of course you may not compare Maximum Risk (oh, what a creative title!) to `Ronin`, but after watching `Knock off` it\xc2\xb4s the hell of a good movie... in special standards, of course.&#39;
b&#39;George Segal lives with his elderly and senile mother. There are many jokes about her Alzheimer\&#39;s-like dementia and most of them aren\&#39;t funny, though there were a few funny moments sprinkled in here and there (such as the nude running through the park scene and the old folks home). At first, Segal tries to kill his mother because she\&#39;s tough to live with and because he\&#39;s a selfish guy. Making the film sort of like a Wiley Coyote versus the Roadrunner comedy where he tries again and again to kill this indestructible gal would have been a hoot--too bad this was NOT the overall tone of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do applaud Carl Reiner\&#39;s attempt to make a tasteless film that is intended to offend everyone. I have a special place in my heart for films like ED AND HIS DEAD MOTHER, EATING RAOUL and HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS--all films about death that dare to offend. The problem here, though, is that WHERE\&#39;S POPPA? has some funny moments, but it also has a lot of flat ones and the overall product is amazingly bland. Plus topics such as homosexual rape, incest and the like are really difficult to make funny. I read in &#34;THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES&#34; that it is considered a cult film, though I just can\&#39;t see anyone wanting to see this more than once.&#39;
b&#34;I am having a hard time finding the words to explain just how much I detested this movie. The historical trial of Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and the Duc de Praslin is a tragic and compelling story that, I feel, had the potential to be a fantastic film, but failed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself, it in no way could make up for the terrible structure of the film, the badly written script and most of all the horrendously overacted characters. The worst of them were the Duc&#39;s children who were so over-the-top-corny and sickeningly fake that it was almost painful to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and profoundly disappointed.&#34;
b&#39;Opie, Tom Gilson,was my brother,so I went to see the movie and I never looked at it again in all these years. Sorry! it was bad. I\&#39;m told I have to write 10 lines so I\&#39;ll put a little trivia in. Tom and Tuesday Weld were to be &#34; introduced &#34; in this picture and Tom was told to take Tuesday to the premiere but Tom said no he was going with Joan Collins, and he did and because he did only Tuesday Weld was Introduced. I found this very funny back then and still do. The movie, while the concept was a funny one, and the actors in it were impressive but some how it just did\&#39;nt come out funny.The continuity was abstract, at best,it was like I was watching 2 different movies at the same time,each running into the other. Sorry, Bob Gilson&#39;
b&#39;Let me start out by saying that I am a huge fan of Abbie Hoffman and have read Steal this Book and Steal this Urine Test. Also am a even bigger Jerry Rubin fan. But his movie was a discusting pile of rubbish that made a very PG version of Abbie Hoffman. The director took no chances into making Abbie Hoffman interesting in this movie. They despicted Stew Albert as a F***ing cartoon chjaractor devoid of intellegence, the man was a proffesor at Berkley for christsakes. Ok they did a horrid casting job for Anita Hoffman, did a Horrible job casting for the Jerry Rubin character. I just guess the movie doesnt fit the news flashes that I have seen of Abbie or the books that he wrote. The movie just didnt fit and upset me. Oh yeah and theat is the absolute worst voice over I have ever heard of Richard Nixon. This is one of the few movies that I have ever rented that I could not sit all the way through because, I have a passion for Abbie Hoffman and his discruntled band of Yippies and this movie was just plain badly done. And it hurt me that now when people see a movie about the yippies they will see a terrible adaptation, and not get a true sense of reality. Instead they get a hollywoodized palanthra of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#39;I see this movie as a poor tribute to the old slasher movies. Because it really doesn\&#39;t hold a candle to the 70\&#39;s and 80\&#39;s gold-era of horror, this is of course where personal taste comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie just falls into the category of &#34;New generation of slashers&#34; in my book, the cast is the typical ones 18-24 years and potential models. I\&#39;m personally quite tired of that image in horror movies, the old movies at least had some variation in people. One or more fat people, and dorks in general. Just plain looking persons, of course having a couple of good lookers is fine they always been there. But when the entire cast is just a bunch of nice racks and butts it\&#39;s getting silly. I mean, OK yeah i like to watch HOT chicks. But not in a horror that is supposed to reflect some ordinary people getting hunted down by for example a knife-wielding maniac... You expect the people being hunted to look something like any random person you see on the street. I think. There are of course a few movies with just good lookers that is perfectly alright, but they aren\&#39;t many. &#34;Wrong turn&#34; is one example of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next point is the killing scenes that slashers should be all about. In this poor movie, all you get to see is 2-3 frames of sudden high pitched sound/scream and music in crescendo. And that\&#39;s it. The little you do get to see isn\&#39;t very graphical at all, not for people who have seen some horrors during the years. The old-school slashers compared to this had much more and better death, blood and gore. Not to mention the killers in those movies, who surpassed the one you\&#39;ll get to see here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for true horror fans it is more fun and exciting to watch horrors with new approaches because of the originalities that pops up, the killer in this one doesn\&#39;t add anything new and fresh to the genre in my opinion. I have to agree with what someone previously stated as well, the CGI is something i hate to watch. Personally i preffere the makeups in that sense I\&#39;m conservative, (unless the CGI is really well done). But most importantly is to set a good setting of mood which allows you to &#34;get into the movie&#34;, a good background story is one very good thing. Also revealing and explaining too much of everything in a movie to the viewers takes away all sense of mystic that adds very much of the mood, and doesn\&#39;t give you much to think about. Just as an example: keeping the killers background a complete mystery for the viewer is a good move in many cases. I mean if everything about the story or the people in it has to be explained or shown in detail, then it\&#39;s not much content left over for the viewer at all to ponder about... That\&#39;s like watching a porno movie and hope for a great story in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the old-school slashers still works, at least for some people. Is because they are established cult movies from the era when they were a new thing, making new ones of that sort today is admittedly hard. The exception might be for people who are newer to that sort of horrors of course. I have noticed that many people does like this sort of horror movies, so there are of course not &#34;A right taste&#34; for horror movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for people out there that might share my opinion; here you have a frame of reference what to expect of this flick.&#39;
b&#39;In the mid-1970s, my NYC apt. building was finally wired for cable-TV and since Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only premium channel offered showing recent movies, I signed up for it. Being a writer and night-owl by nature, I soon discovered the channel was showing movies late at night and until the wee hours of the morning I\&#39;d never even heard of--most of them American independent films and foreign films that had never been given a U.S. theatrical release. Many of them had recognizable &#34;star&#34; casts and respectable directors, and thanks to Showtime, I discovered many first-rate films I (and other Showtime subscribers) would never else have had the opportunity to see. Most of these cinematic mongrels were indeed &#34;dogs&#34; but often so bad they were unintentionally hilarious. One night, Showtime unveiled a little Italian-made gem called &#34;Redneck&#34; (filmed in 1972, given a limited European release in 1973). Even though the movie had never been released in the U.S., the MPAA rating was listed as an \&#39;R\&#39;. Since the director was one Sylvio Narizzano (the director who made his name with the glorious &#34;Georgy Girl&#34;), and the three leads were Mark (&#34;Oliver&#34;) Lester, Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas, I decided to give it a try. And found myself nailed to my TV screen in disbelief for 89 minutes. As I recall, Savalas and Testi played two criminals, the former a raging maniac who, in one stomach-churning scene, casually sent a German family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff, thereby plunging to the wilderness depths below. So far, so bad. Then, out of nowhere, Testi (as the &#34;nice&#34; psycho) and Lester (all of 14 when the movie was made) are seen, both nude, in a men\&#39;s room, Testi sneaking peeks at the kid\&#39;s body while shaving, and poor confused Lester fixated on close-ups of Testi\&#39;s naked butt. As a not-yet-jaded member of the movie industry, and a card-carrying liberal (I was as much against censorship then as I am today), the entire movie made me queasy (and, being the early \&#39;70s when I thoughtI\&#39;d seen everything in the anything-goes movies of that liberated era--including the uncut version of Altman\&#39;s &#34;That Cold Day in the Park&#34;, a real jaw-dropper until it was trimmed for an \&#39;R\&#39; rating and would have spelled The End for Altman\&#39;s career had he not next come up with something called &#34;M*A*S*H&#34;), I still wonder if anyone else except me ever saw &#34;Redneck&#34; and was appalled as I was. Trashing the actors and movie-going audiences is joy maladjusted filmmakers have been merrily indulging in since the beginning of time. But leeringly exploiting a highly respected and talented child actor (Mr. Lester) at a time when he was beginning to make the difficult transaction from child to adult actor (and I\&#39;m sure his film offers had thereby dwindled to meretricious junk like &#34;Redneck&#34;)...Mr. Narizzano, you should be hanging your head in shame. (Incidentally, I was soon to make friends with actors who had appeared in Narizzano\&#39;s future, undistinguished efforts. They both despised him. Surprise?)&#39;
b&#39;If you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the &#34;villain&#34; not be more sympathetic than the &#34;victim&#34;. And this fails miserably. It was so terrible and frustrating to watch that I was actually moved to register and comment. OK, so the husband is rich and cocky. There are worse vices, and the cabana boy and wife display plenty. The husband is a jerk because he - um, didn\&#39;t approve of the cabana boy physically assaulting that woman - the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot BTW. The cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife. He then forces himself on her - which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him. Uh huh. The misogynistic, inferiority complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting. It is one thing when a fine film like American Psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathise with the villain but in Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims. What was he thinking???&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Changi&#34; is an Australian comedy/drama set in the World War 2 Japanese prisoner of war camp of that name. The story cuts between past events, and the present day, when the aged veterans plan a reunion. This is a much publicised and controversial miniseries, here in Australia. The budget ran over ($6.5 million Aust. dollars); historians and veterans criticised it\&#39;s authenticity; and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama (shades of &#34;Pearl Harbor&#34;). Series writer John Doyle (half of the successful Roy &amp; H.G. comedy team), has tried to defend himself with comments about &#34;the characters are composites of actual people&#34;; &#34;the troops used comedy to cope with the situation&#34;; &#34;it\&#39;s only based on actual events&#34;; &#34;one of our actors was actually there&#34; etc. I don\&#39;t have a problem with any of these points. Many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the Japanese P.O.W. camp experience: &#34;King Rat&#34;, &#34;Tenko&#34;, &#34;Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence&#34;, &#34;Bridge on the River Kwai&#34;, &#34;Paradise Road&#34;, &#34;Empire of the Sun&#34;, &#34;Blood Oath&#34;, and &#34;A Town Like Alice&#34;. Black comedy has often been used successfully in P.O.W dramas: &#34;Life is Beautiful&#34;, &#34;The Great Escape&#34;, &#34;Seven Beauties&#34;, &#34;Stalag 17&#34;, &#34;The Colditz Story&#34;, and even &#34;Hogan\&#39;s Heroes&#34;. So why is &#34;Changi&#34; a monumental failure? - the acting in &#34;Changi&#34; is uniformly excellent, the music and cinematography is good - it is the writing and direction that have let it down. Every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. When Anthony Hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun, I thought &#34;Didn\&#39;t I see Alec Guinness do this in &#34;Bridge on the River Kwai&#34;?&#34;. The sudden flashes into surreal song &amp; dance brought back Dennis Potter\&#39;s &#34;Singing Detective&#34;, but without the finesse. This borrowing happened so often, it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste, rather than homage. The constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either. Flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me distanced from characters, where intensity was called for. The &#34;Ausiness&#34; is overdone - every conversation seemed to include &#34;stone the bloody crows&#34; &amp; such, that I was saying &#34;I get the point, I know they\&#39;re Aussies&#34;. Cultural stereotyping extended to the British and Japanese too -sadistic young Japanese officer; uptight British officer; wiser Japanese commandant; fun-loving, rascally Aussies etc. I thought I was watching &#34;Hogan\&#39;s Heroes on the River Kwai&#34;. After 3 episodes I\&#39;m tuning out.&#39;
b&#34;I stopped watching this film half way through. It was just terrible! Boring, contrived subplots. A complete lack of the pathos seen in Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill, or Steve Railsback&#39;s portrayal of Ed Gein. A movie doesn&#39;t have to be historically accurate, but the true story of Ed Gein is so much more interesting than this third-rate melodrama that was completely made up for no good reason! Ed Gein as portrayed by Kane Hodder is a cartoon sadist. The attempts to show the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are just weak exercises in recycled style. And this movie wanted to be stylish, but it even screwed that up. Fortunately, there is a better film of this story. 2001&#39;s Ed Gein told the story efficiently, and offered a few real chills as we watched a sick man not in control of himself. Steve Railsback, who played Ed Gein that time, was already famous for memorably portraying another famous serial killer: Charles Manson. His Ed had pathos. His film is the one to see. Avoid this mess.&#34;
b&#39;My boss at the time and showed it to us at a Halloween party at our office. He is the Chris Huntley that co-wrote and acted in it. He knows it\&#39;s bad, we know it\&#39;s bad and we all agree that the monster looks WAY too much like a vagina to be coincidence. Maybe it was from a gynocological experiment gone wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a VERY low budget and the actors were all friends so what you have here is a case of &#34;hey gang, lets\&#39; put on a show&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody got hurt and it was a first attempt. Nothing wrong with that. It gave us all a good laugh and it\&#39;s a great film to watch with friends and make fun of. :-)&#39;
b&#39;I just finished watching this horribly depressing drama and realized that, in light of recent dramas such as these, the only ones who could be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic. I would suggest how nauseatingly defeatist and counter-productive this conclusion is, even if relationships and outlooks like those presented in this movie are grounded in fact to some degree. But, instead, I realized that these films have made the very determination of the great &#34;tragedy&#34; trivial when the same boring situations, the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out just have they been over and over again in some sort of attempt to knock out previous distortions of family life (much of it existing in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character aberrations being made ever so subtle), supplanting it instead with the &#34;reality&#34; of how things actually are. That in fact, what we are watching is no longer the dysfunctional, but in fact, a normal existence and set of circumstances that has actually existed all along, but of which we may have been previously been unaware and thus, have ignored or at least denied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is, that too many films have been trying to make this point. And by doing so in nearly identical form. When I had read the synopsis for the film, I immediately thought of \&#39;Ice Storm.\&#39; While watching the depressing lifelessness of the Travis family, which seemed to endure repeated emotional berating, I immediately recalled \&#39;American Beauty.\&#39; And, in some regards, the interactions between the parents and the middle child, Tim, I drew similarities from \&#39;Igby Goes Down.\&#39; \&#39;Imaginary Heroes\&#39; may be a novel experience, maybe a refreshing one deemed so for an honest portrayal of character that, as said before, is often not permitted to exist in the films of family (which is idiotic to think anyways, considering we were already seeing these kinds of relationships displayed in films like \&#39;Ordinary People\&#39; as early as 1980 and which go back even further than that). But, to the well-versed viewer, these films may offer nothing new. They have in fact, become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who may try to out-do the other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can pack into one family (and here, it extends to neighbors and friends). In fact, \&#39;Imaginary Heroes,\&#39; the latest in this genre (I do think there have been enough films to accurately declare it a \&#39;genre\&#39;), crams so many disasters and surprises into one family, that they would make prize finds for a daytime talk show host. It is the story of a family who is tested by the suicide of the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who hated the sport with a passion. The youngest son knew this, the father was in a daze and blinded by the push for competitiveness in his all-star son. And it\&#39;s not clear that the mother and sister had much of a relationship with the young man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it is no less entertaining (to some extent, for those who find this material exhaustively depressing after a while), and the performances are quite good, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. But, I sure hope that filmmakers in the future wishing to add to the commentary of struggling familial relationships (which coincidentally or not always seem to be upper-middle class white suburban families) intend to offer something new by way of material and insight. I should see no distinction (and consequently, no purpose) otherwise.&#39;
b&#34;This film could have been great- but wasn&#39;t. Amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent. The main star of the film plays a good lead role. He is convincing and has those scary Italian eyes. However, he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across. The opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like Gay Porno. Fortunately no one stripped off. The rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish. The prison sequence was the best part of the film- although irrelevant. The movies soundtrack (if you can call it that) sounds like a teenage boys first attempt at using cooledit and some sample cds. It is boring, repetitive and extremely lame. In fact the whole film is lame. Get out while you still can!&#34;
b&#39;Dull acting, weak script...worst spanish movie in years...I was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;attracted by the (naked) beauty of Paz Vega, but as an actress&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she\&#39;s useless, you almost can\&#39;t understand what she\&#39;s saying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the story there\&#39;s not much coherent to say...we heard of it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;before, but as this is a &#34;modern Carmen&#34; we find a few changes: -The french soldier is now a basque soldier. -Merimee himself is a character in the story. -Carmen is a dangerous &#34;bandolera&#34; in love with a famous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;matador&#34; and she can speak fluent basque...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can anyone understand this mess?&#39;
b&#39;Hooray for Title Misspellings! After reading reviews and contemplating, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this movie is an utter piece of trash. This movie lost her as one of those Rare Tarantino fans.I wish it were made on nitrate film, and all the copies piled neatly underneath a chain-smoking Tarantino fanboy. The literally needless violence, the plot holes, Tarantino\&#39;s table-itis sans drama, and absent character development made this a thoroughly painful, glorified montage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What acting was there? And how much of that was just because I was too busy reading the subtitles? I watch my share of fansubbed anime, and kudos for the attempt at authenticity, but it was overdone for an English-language movie. With the glaring historical inadequacies, the constant reading killed what acting there was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why pay money for a narrator who will have absolutely no tie to any of the characters, plot, themes, setting, or anything involved in the movie? When the movie needs that sort of off hand explanation, it\&#39;s foreshadowing the utter filth that follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historical Research - while it was sprinkled with interesting factiods, used the proper costumes and props for the soldiers, this movie stretched the truth beyond belief even for historical fiction. Kudos on Mata Hari reference, though using it as foreshadowing was a bit much. Mata Hari was executed by a firing squad, not choked in an isolated room. This ruined any sense that the reference may have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews mention more than half a dozen homages to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Considering the audience, all these and other references were completely lost on many who would bother to see this movie, and all who would enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m confused by his choices of when to start a scene, end it, and what needs to be included. In a movie promoted as an action film, why did it take nearly 20 minutes to set up any sort of testosterone? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I believe to be the message was trite. The idea of rats and how we act on a primal nature against them, and &#34;who is the rat?&#34; were at best clich\xc3\xa9d, but at worst not realized. Mention of American camps for the Japanese and German Americans would have added legitimacy to this question to the moral high ground. Literally every character in the film that gets a speaking role was caught up in their own legend. Is that the world in which Tarantino lives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m glad I didn\&#39;t pay to see this one. I regret that I bothered to view it at all, even with well-meaning hosts. There was a rich base of ideas to develop, but none were realized.&#39;
b&#34;This movie, like so many others (Remember the Titans, Miracle), follows the basic sports-movie formula: There&#39;s a guy, he&#39;s a jerk. Jerk does bad. Jerk must play by someone else&#39;s rules. Someone else&#39;s rules change Jerk, Jerk becomes good. Insert tragedy (Death, drugs, riots, etc.). Tragedy effects Jerk, makes him totally change. Jerk must now play championship game. Lots of close-ups on the sweating players and the balls. Jerk wins. Quote from coach or news or something that explains title. Credits. Weren&#39;t you touched? These movies can now be used to sort out the morons of society. Anyone who pays to see this in theatres must be slapped.&#34;
b&#34;This has got to be the worst case of over acting since the silent era. Not just one or two actors but virtually the entire cast. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were fine but the rest of them look like their first time acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the budget was not tremendous. Much of the costumes and set were believable but there were many things that jump out at the viewer to let us know that they couldn&#39;t double check or get all of the props to match the period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t think of one aspect of the film that I liked or didn&#39;t shake my head. Your time will be better spent burning lint collected from your bellybutton.&#34;
b&#34;Pacino, and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker. I swear, I am an avid movie goer and fan. I have been a fan of most of the people in this abortion at one time or another. Until now. The story-crap The acting- crap(Rene Ruso-Major League was good) The plot-crap The subplot-garbage The teenage attempts to relate to sports betting-junk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have vowed to watch Romy and Michelle&#39;s High School reunion 2 times a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not turning this colostomy bag of a movie off after 10 minutes. I was out of town for a seminar, and this pile of mung cost me $9.99, and 2 hours. I have been cheated. This director should be in jail for fraud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get with me if you have other review questions. I am always right.&#34;
b&#39;This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking, &#34;Oh yeah, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, wasn\&#39;t there?&#34; This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). I even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because I am a fan of both Mr. Magoo, and Mr. Nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo. I even remember the opening animated credits, because I thought that they were pretty amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, though, its all a complete blank. I think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame, so bland, and so utterly without merit that you can\&#39;t remember ANYTHING from it. I understand that Leslie Nielson isn\&#39;t always known for appearing in first class comedies, but I saw him in &#34;Spy Hard,&#34; in &#34;Scary Movie 4,&#34; and &#34;Police Squad 3&#34; and none of these were great movies, but I came away at least remembering *something*. Mr. Magoo, though, is a complete blank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasn\&#39;t actually generated by the studio that produced it, in the hopes of generating at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.&#39;
b&#39;The script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) &#34;borrowed&#34; from a certain other movie involving using a self-propelled manned drilling machine. Scene by scene, the two movies were almost identical. Just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, I have to say I found this somewhat entertaining as I enjoy deep-underground-in-the-earth genre of movies. It\&#39;s a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes, but if one is willing to squint one\&#39;s eyes real hard and pretend one didn\&#39;t notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over, this movie is almost bearable. Far better than &#34;Supernova&#34; which was another flick that Luke Perry had a leading role in that was so dumb, dumb, dumb that nothing could save it. A note to movie makers: employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with. It would be a very small part of the movie budget, but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Production values: almost passable. I\&#39;ve seen far worse in my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again, how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure. Particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity. Stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, &#34;No matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed.&#34; Which is definitely not the case. A self-caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of &#34;Don\&#39;t be so damn stupid in the first place.&#34; Should you watch this movie? If you\&#39;re bored and you\&#39;ve seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, sure, why not. But do avoid &#34;Supernova&#34; as I can assure you that you\&#39;re not THAT bored. That definitely was not one of Luke Perry\&#39;s better movies. This one is better. That\&#39;s not saying much, but it is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One dead hoof up for being a deep-underground genre movie. One dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre.&#39;
b&#34;I&#39;ve never made one of these before, but this movie was literally so bad I had to say something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m all for independent film-making as the past year has seen of the worst (in my opinion) of Hollywood&#39;s showings, the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about. That being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with. The direction is horrible, the plotting is horrible, the plot itself is horrible, stay away, far away. Only one brief scene featuring a female&#39;s nude breasts, and even that wasn&#39;t worth a second look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ever having to watch it again. I gave it a 2 and not a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible - it earns one point for each of those traits.&#34;
b&#39;Essentially this is a dreadful film with a few features that may or may not redeem it for you, depending on how much you want them to. In &#34;opening up&#34; &#34;The Red Green Show&#34; for the big screen, the filmmakers jettisoned the rustic charm carefully honed over a decade\&#39;s worth of episodes set in and around Possum Lodge in favor of a blandly-photographed &#34;road movie&#34; with a ghastly faux-Hollywood &#34;big&#34; musical score and profoundly boring storyline that\&#39;s not embellished with enough good gags to make it as entertaining as even the most mediocre episode of the TV series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having devised a plotline that keeps most of the members of Possum Lodge offscreen for most of the film and requires virtually everyone concerned to be despicably mean to the loveable Harold (who\&#39;s the hero of the film, the usually affably crusty Red being relegated in this incarnation to nothing more than the role of head Harold abuser), the only performers who really get to shine are Patrick McKenna and Peter Keleghan as Harold and Ranger Gord, who deliver satisfyingly large-screen versions of their small-screen characters.&#39;
b&#39;I remember this movie with feelings of sheer . . . agony. More than half of the film is commercials (no, really!). The slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes (and almost is!) The end result is a prefab love story of predictable schlock, all obviously thrown together in a crassly commercial attempt to wring a few more bucks from the contemporary Debbie Boone hit. Yep, that\&#39;s how fast it was produced... the song that &#34;inspired&#34; it was still big on the charts when the film was released!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite decades of seeing bad movies, this one still impresses me for its extravagant, no-holds-barred, headlong jump into the most tedious, absurd, and indelible cinematic badness. It truly deserves to be on the IMDb list of the 100 worst of all time, and has never left the top 3 on my personal &#34;worst&#34; list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy it for the sheer masochistic thrill!&#39;
b&#34;Oh, boy, it&#39;s another comet-hitting-the-earth film. Coming within a year or two of Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them, you&#39;d think people would be burned out on this concept. Apparently not, since I rented it, hoping it MIGHT not be awful: Dennis Hopper was in it, after all, and he&#39;s a good actor, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot something important: along with Peter O&#39;Toole, Robert De Niro and quite a few other esteemed actors, Hopper has a penchant for appearing in dreadful films. Not only that, but he seems to prepare for them by taking forget-how-to-act classes. His performance in Tychus is so awful that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know what else to say about this rubbish, other than if you&#39;re into things crashing into the earth films, watch Deep Impact, and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys at a stretch. Forget the others altogether. This one really is bottom of the pile.&#34;
b&#34;One of the most boring movies I&#39;ve ever had to sit through, it&#39;s completely formulaic. Just a cookie cutout of a movie, you could predict about every scene in the movie just from knowing the genre, as this movie adds nothing new. The dialogue is never funny, interesting, or intelligent. The acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying - basically everything looks to have been done by an amatuer filmmaker. Nothing fresh, memorable, or entertaining in this movie, combined with the fact that it is LONG gives it an easy thumbs down. Sorry, fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Grade: F&#34;
b&#39;This has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap I have ever watched. It makes Mel Brooks movies Oscar-worthy by comparison. Jim VanBebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as ANY form of entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as &#34;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#34; or &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34;, the production value is not in question. It is VanBebber\&#39;s ability to cast and present a plausible story line. The casting is deplorable. For the role of Charlie he must have picked the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair. Never mind that this actor\&#39;s hair came halfway down his back, (Manson\&#39;s never went much past his shoulders) this actor spoke in a dreadful monotone without so much as a fraction of the personality that Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies lent to their portrayals of Manson. The actor chosen to play &#34;Tex&#34; Watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair, a fact that anyone who has shown even the most remote interest in the Manson case knows. He looks like a Minnesota farmer on &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34; The actress playing Susan Atkins has a butt wider than Oprah\&#39;s, While those familiar with the Family members know that &#34;Clem&#34; was considered somewhat retarded, the actor portraying him did so in such a campy, Chaplinesque way it was like watching an old Vaudevile act. Instead of Sharon Tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looked like bloated, alcoholic trailer trash. VanBebber speeds up the filming in some places for artistic effect yet this technique hasn\&#39;t proved remotely useful since &#34;The Munsters&#34;. The end credits list every known family member yet we are never introduced to the majority of them and those we are introduced to we aren\&#39;t sure who they are sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facts are destroyed in this movie as well. &#34;Lotsapoppa&#34; did not die in real life, Steven Parent was shot four times, not twice, Abagail Folger did not have her throat slit, Where were Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis during the Himnan Murder? Patricia Krenwinkel never sported a &#34;Dorothy Hamill&#34; hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most baffling aspect of this movie is what the modern day &#34;freaks&#34; had to do with this movie? Why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo attached? What was their problem with the journalist? What was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? Why were they included, period? The viewer never knows! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy mackerel, I could go on and on but space prevents it. Don\&#39;t try to eat popcorn during this garbage because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeatedly say &#34;What the f---?&#34;&#39;
b&#39;I truly was disappointed by this film which I had high hopes for. It seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time (including MGM\&#39;s own &#34;Libeled Lady&#34;, which featured two of the same stars) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Three years into their pairing, they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together, but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year\&#39;s &#34;Libeled Lady&#34; and the two &#34;Thin Man&#34; movies they had done prior to this. &#34;Double Wedding&#34; tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer, Myrna Loy, who is intent on dominating the life of her sister (Florence Rice), future brother-in-law (John Beal), and her own servants (which include Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon). When the independent spirited William Powell comes into her life, having distracted Rice and Beal from Loy\&#39;s constant control, Loy meets her match. Sounds good so far, right? Yeah, an interesting premise falls short, sad to say, because Loy\&#39;s character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see Powell fall in love with her, which we know will soon happen. It\&#39;s another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading, something Hollywood did often during its golden age. When Loy says she doesn\&#39;t have time to both run her business and have a man in her life, its a groaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, other than Powell, there is free-spirited Jessie Ralph on board. A salty wealthy older woman who helped Loy start her business, she has an acquaintance with Powell and can see immediately through Loy\&#39;s cool claims that she loathes him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise of Powell getting between them is senseless. Then, an ex-wife of Powell\&#39;s shows up, which really isn\&#39;t necessary at that late point in the story, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people try to get into Powell\&#39;s tiny trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce. (It is funny though, that Powell keeps getting hit by items meant by Loy to hit Edgar Kennedy with; Those chuckles are most welcome, since there are so few others.) Powell and Loy would do better in two later screwball comedies, &#34;I Love You Again&#34; and &#34;Love Crazy&#34;, which are sophisticated, witty, and fun. This film attempts to be all three, but ends up a sophisticated bore.&#39;
b&#34;Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of the all-time greatest comedy team, he laboured under contract to Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheapies, many of which were parodies of major Hollywood features. Most of Laurel&#39;s &#39;parody&#39; films are only mildly funny, and even less funny for modern audiences who haven&#39;t seen the original movie which Laurel is parodying. Fortunately, &#39;Mud and Sand&#39; lampoons a movie which is still well known: &#39;Blood and Sand&#39;, starring Rudolph Valentino. &#39;Blood and Sand&#39; was released only nine weeks before this parody, giving you some idea of how quickly Broncho Billy&#39;s movies were ground out, edited and distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Various sources (including IMDb) state that Stan Laurel&#39;s character in this film is named Rhubarb Vaselino, with a final &#39;o&#39;. I&#39;ve screened a print of &#39;Mud and Sand&#39; with the original titles (in Hobo type font), so I report that Laurel&#39;s role is actually cried Rhubarb Vaseline, with an &#39;e&#39;. But I agree that &#39;Vaselino&#39; is funnier. Laurel copies the elaborate sideburns which Valentino wore in &#39;Blood and Sand&#39; (he should&#39;ve made them longer!), and there&#39;s a parody of Valentino&#39;s dressing scene from that movie, which made female movie-goers swoon in 1922. A se\xc3\xb1orita named Carmen in the original film is parodied here as Caramel (a girl I&#39;d like to sink my teeth into).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie (like the original) apparently takes place in Spain, yet there&#39;s a Prohibition gag. Laurel uses a distinctive hat-tipping gesture here which could have become a trademark for him (like Hardy&#39;s distinctive necktie twiddle), but I&#39;ve never spotted it in any other Laurel film. There&#39;s some amusing dialogue: Rhubarb Vaseline tells the other matadors to &#39;Save a bull for me.&#39; When Vaseline becomes a successful toreador, a lackey tells him &#39;The bull is without, sir&#39; ... which is funny, but I was disappointed that Laurel didn&#39;t reply &#39;Without WHAT?&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s one funny moment here which almost certainly wasn&#39;t planned, when Vaseline shows up for the bullfighter auditions. Laurel swaggers into the bullring, and -- before you can say &#39;corrida querida&#39; -- he tosses a bull over the fence, where it lands with a thump near the other auditioners. The bull is obviously a fake, but the gag is funny anyway ... and, aye, there&#39;s a title card with a joke about &#39;throwing the bull&#39;. The serendipitous moment occurs when Laurel repeats the gag, and Vaseline slings a second bull over the fence. This one lands on its butt, and balances upright for just an instant before toppling. VERY funny! If somebody planned that gag in this quickie comedy, I salute the unknown gagsmith ... and the tech man who rigged the bull to land in that position. More likely it happened by luck, and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the silent era, whenever Hollywood made a big-budget feature film which was set anyplace where the people don&#39;t speak English, it was a common cinematic device to show a piece of text or an inscription in the local lingo, then dissolve to a shot of the same text in English. I was surprised that this low-budget comedy spent the money to copy that device here: we see a notice-board outside the corrida with a message in Spanish, then it dissolves to the same text in English. Unfortunately, the photography in this cheapo movie is so dark that the effect is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actresses in this movie are attractive ... including Broncho Billy&#39;s wife Leona Anderson and Stan Laurel&#39;s common-law wife Mae Dahlberg; the latter briefly does a pretty dance. (Mae had danced in Stan&#39;s vaudeville act.) I was surprised to spot Charlie Chaplin&#39;s half-brother Wheeler Dryden in a brief role, since Chaplin had nothing to do with this movie. In &#39;Mud and Sand&#39;, Laurel gives a funny performance that&#39;s quite unlike his later familiar Stanley character ... but this film is much less funny than his brilliant work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: just 3 out of 10. TRIVIA NOTE: Twenty-three years later, in Stan Laurel&#39;s very last American film -- &#39;The Bullfighters&#39; (1945) -- he again played a Spanish bullfighter (with his Spanish voice post-dubbed). Coincidentally, that film used stock footage from &#39;Blood and Sand&#39;: not Valentino&#39;s movie, but the Tyrone Power remake. &#39;Mud and Sand&#39; is funnier than &#39;The Bullfighters&#39;, but not much.&#34;
b&#34;I&#39;m not a big fan of musicals, although this technically might not qualify as a musical. But I thought I would give it a chance as I love war movies. It was mediocre at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role. It just didn&#39;t work for me. Julie Andrews probably played her part as best as she could, but I just find it hard to buy her as a conniving, deceptive spy. Sorry, I know that is classic stereotyping on my part. But I have to say I think this is Julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking. I always thought of her as more matronly, but then surely that&#39;s a result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. No doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role. She was quite beguiling in appearance here, but I still didn&#39;t buy her as a spy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#39;t keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and having conversations with those in my room (which I usually never do - I&#39;m always shushing everybody). So that tells you how little it held my attention. Don&#39;t waste your time!&#34;
b&#34;It seems that there is great potential for the story line of this film to be something worth watching. The acting was flat and the story lacked depth. There was too much reliance on camera work, which had some high points. I have to agree with the other negative comments. I only wish I had read them before buying the DVD. The film may be worth watching for free and you are bored to tears before hand. There could have been a lot more plot development with why there are homeless in Moscow (i.e. post-Soviet &#39;capitalism&#39;, rampant drug usage (i.e. increased heroin trafficking from Afghanistan); more development of why the resurgence of Russian Orthodoxy after the fall of the U.S.S.R.; the archaeologists themselves; or even more into the struggle against nihilism.&#34;
b&#39;Can anyone give me a reason why only one American dies in this movie, and when he does, it is supposed to be a very emotional scene, yet when the Operation Delta Force team kills hundreds of Russians, in slow-motion action scenes, or thousands of Arabs, also in slow-motion action scenes, you are supposed to cheer and say &#34;Take that, you non-American monsters!&#34;. I know I used &#34;slow-motion action scenes&#34; a lot, but that is because every action scene in this movie is in, you guessed it, slow-motion. Every last one of them... And this squad should be called &#34;Invincible Slow-Motion Bullet-Dodging Force&#34;, since they seem to have supernatural powers that help them to dodge bullets. And if this supernatural power fails, they have some kind of regeneration superpower, which is all they need to kill the complete non-American army that stands between them and victory. By this point, nobody cares since they have been put to sleep by another laughable slow-motion action scene... That is if they are not laughing out loud at the bad acting, cheesy dialogues and incredibly poor story. Which is what I did... The cast is made of unknown actors, which will probably remain unknown since they don\&#39;t even play characters. They are just playing guys with guns(and, lets not forget, superpowers)... The only quality is that the special effects are surprisingly not that bad(although they are in slow-motion) for a TV movie... But it still sucks... and at the same time is so bad it\&#39;s good... OK, maybe at the end it gets a little too repetitive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;25%&#39;
b&#39;Talk about false advertising! I wasted an hour and twenty five minutes watching this piece of crap and there was not one leisure suit, not one platform shoe, no pointy-finger dancing, and not a single disco ball. I watched it on a Saturday night, and ended up with an awful fever, but it had nothing to do with the music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, with or without John Travolta, this movie sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the opening scene, you will be asking yourself the question, &#34;Where did that rope come from, and will it please hang me, too?&#34; From its unabashed bias against the driving abilities of the Pennsylvania Dutch, to the shameless promotion of the apparently everlasting capacities of Alienware laptop batteries, to the cheap horror effects lifted directly from Japanese cinema, this is the worst film to hit theaters since The Grudge.&#39;
b&#34;I registered at IMDb solely for the purpose of warning others about this movie. Hwo does anyone ever get funding for projects like this? That&#39;s the mystery. Farewell to Harry might be the worst movie ever, except that I tried to erase the others that rival this blathering idiocy. Bad plot, not-credible logic runs throughout. I can&#39;t spoil this movie for you by revealing anything that would make your experience less enjoyable. There is nothing enjoyable about this movie. I have the CD and will send it to you for free, it is that bad. First come, only served. If I know you, this offer is void, because I wouldn&#39;t inflict this movie on anyone, not on purpose. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.&#34;
b&#39;I don\&#39;t even know where to start. I did not like it. It did not behave like a story and so much was injected into the movie (the pot brownies, the son was gay (?) the murder was justified, what possible reason could there be in the script for Linda aka Penelope to exist) that was never explained. It was all fluid spilled on a table and left dripping off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a five second cameo? Why did Diane Wiest use her Bullets over Broadway character without the camp-fun? Why was Jane Birkin in the storyline to begin with. The list is endless. The movie ended and we all looked at each other -- like -- did you understand any of this??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell ya one thing, if I watched my long lost Dad get murdered I certainly wouldn\&#39;t be hugging the murderer. Tell ya another thing, if &#34;Bob&#34; broke up with &#34;Bob&#34; what purpose did hiding the son in the closet have? Was Bob going to have sex with Bob in front of the son? How did the murderer contact the son so easily? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review sounds confused, it is because this was a waste of film, talent and time. What the heck did the dead shrink have to do with anything!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jezz, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen because it should have/could have been better, stronger and it should have made some kind of sense. Any sense. Instead we are given a watered down &#34;Diva&#34; (the film from the 70s complete with a murder) and tired performances reading boring words from a script that is completely insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By pass it folks. Or maybe me and the rest of the people who reviewed this film are too stupid to understand it all -- I mean after all it is a french film.&#39;
b&#39;Scanning through the comments, there doesn\&#39;t appear to be a lot of love for this movie, and it\&#39;s not very hard to see why, it\&#39;s rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will start by saying that the finished product was hurt, in any number of ways, by the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr Loomis) in post production. This required a re-jigging of the film\&#39;s conclusion with Loomis buying the farm and took away what was supposed to be a double twist at the end with Micheal swapping places with mysterious &#34;Man in black&#34; and I do not mean Johnny Cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the story. The fifth movie ended rather unsatisfactorily with Micheal Myers escaping from jail with the mysterious man in black. It turns out (aggh) that this man knows the origin of Micheal\&#39;s evil and is also a colleague of Dr Loomis named Dr Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in parts 4 and 5 but here played by JC Brandy). Jamie, pregnant, escapes from Dr Wynn\&#39;s lair and so Micheal follows her and kills her. But she\&#39;d had the kid so now he needs to track the baby down so he can kill his great nephew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hear some ludicrous explanation to Micheal\&#39;s evil involving Gaelic curses down bloodlines and mysterious symbols. A radio show is broadcast from Micheal\&#39;s home town for some reason, which gives Micheal some more hapless victims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end the movie, just like this review is vague, confusing and directionless with a very anticlimactic ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some sex scenes and nudity. Poor plot, passable effects, with some good run of the mill slasher kills, but severely lacking in motivation. For what was supposed to explain everything, this only stirred up some new questions, made parts 4 and 5 pointless and was a poor way for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and career.&#39;
b&#39;As long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a copyright ploy, and not intended as a serious release, it is actually surprising how not absolutely horrible it is. I even liked the theme music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if ever a flick cried out for a treatment by Joel (or Mike) and the MST3K Bots, this is it! Watch this with a bunch of smart-ass wise-crackers, and you\&#39;re in for a good time. Have a brew, butter up some large pretzels, and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, obtaining a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware, but if you\&#39;re here on the IMDb, then you\&#39;re most likely savvy enough to do so. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And look for my favorite part....where Dr. Doom informs the FF that they have 12 hours to comply with his wishes....and he actually gestures the number &#34;12&#34; with his finger while doing so....it\&#39;s like &#34;Evil Sesame Street&#34;....hoo boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and of course Mrs. Storm declaring &#34;Just look at you....the Fanstastic Four&#34; is just so heartwarming....you\&#39;ll laugh, you\&#39;ll cry.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you love schlocky Sci-Fi, this one\&#39;s Fantastic For you!&#39;
b&#39;The best thing about &#34;The Prey&#34; is the tag line...&#34;It\&#39;s not human and it\&#39;s got an axe&#34;! The movie itself is a padded stinkaroo....endless insect and wildlife shots make the viewer wanna die! No slasher fan will like this garbage.....Watch &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; again and burn any copy of this film you find! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also rates as one of the 25 worst films ever made!&#39;
b&#34;There&#39;s no better way to describe the HORRENDOUS experience that&#39;s to watch Mamma Mia: Hitler must be looking up, saying to the pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd &#39;You monster, what have you done?&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything about the movie is wrong. Just\xc2\x85 Wrong! Even its success, which is unexplainable. I can understand when those crappy parody movies, like Epic Movie, make their minimal share of money and turn profit just because they&#39;re cheap (of course they are!). But when something like Mamma Mia makes 450 million dollars worldwide, you think &#39;what the hell is wrong with the world?&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to think we have Meryl Streep, one of the greatest alive actresses of the world, in it? What was she thinking? &#39;I need the money&#39;, she could say. Well then, sell one of your grandchildren, even that would be less embarrassing. It&#39;s not that Meryl is good in a disastrous piece of, err, &#39;movie&#39;. She&#39;s also disastrous! When she sings, even though she&#39;s got the vocals, it&#39;s ridiculous. Worse than her only Pierce Brosnan. He used to be James Bond. Now he&#39;s singing Abba in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever. Really? And when I mention Abba, not that I have anything against the band and their music. Though it doesn&#39;t help them when actors started singing (badly), dancing (worse) and the extras join then (They pop out of nowhere! Frequently!) to present one terrible musical sequences after the other. You wanna cry when the music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first in the genre where you PRAY for actual silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could keep going. The list goes on forever. You could write a Stephen King novel with the complete list of mistakes in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up: go watch it! Really! You&#39;ve got to witness to understand!! And since it&#39;s already a huge success, who cares if it makes a few more dollars from you? And it&#39;s not liking you&#39;re selling your soul to the devil. Meryl did that before. For the whole mankind. And now the world must end, because we&#39;ve committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed.&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;ve watched a number of Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme movies lately, and have found a lot to like about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This SRE movie seemed a lot more slight than all the others I\&#39;ve seen. Perhaps that\&#39;s because this is a comedy/horror movie rather than straight horror, and perhaps it\&#39;s also because the humor didn\&#39;t register with me very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a little less than seventy minutes long, and the credits begin as the last ten minutes are beginning. There are some outtakes, goofs, and behind the scenes stuff going on while those credits roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SRE movies do tend to be short, and tend to feel padded out in spite of that. This is no exception, with some scenes that tend to go on too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story involves a poor kid in Christmastown, California who\&#39;d been picked on by all his classmates. He\&#39;d had one shoe stolen, and unable to replace it, he was dubbed &#34;Oneshoe McGroo.&#34; Due to an obsession with pirates, his parents gave him an eyepatch for Christmas with a Christmas tree emblazoned on the eyepatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the classmates are killed, and the few who remain gather together to decide what to do. They\&#39;re picked off one by one by McGroo, who stalks around to the sound of sleigh bells ringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are pretty much all broad stereotypes, like the nerd named Dorkus, etc. There\&#39;s an odd scene in which a kinky couple has sex; the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, the man wears a large paper watermelon slice over his head. This reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes from director Rinse Dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture quality is good, and there are a lot of extras. But basically a pretty silly movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I guess you can never have too many Christmas horror movies. Still, there are a lot of other needy holidays.&#39;
b&#39;This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I\&#39;ve seen in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s marketed as as Sci-Fi when in fact it\&#39;s nothing more than a Christian recruiting tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tells you quite a bit about the state of the Christian church, when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. But then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war mongers. Let\&#39;s not forget, our bumbling former President actually came out and said that &#34;God told him&#34; to invade Iraq. And nobody questioned if he was hearing voices, or seeing things? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, going of the subject here. No this movie has nothing to do with UFOs whatsoever, it\&#39;s nothing more than a religious production.&#39;
b&#39;A plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm--including the CEO\&#39;s daughter--goes down in thick forest in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is called off, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission. But just what is Knowles searching for and trying to rescue, and just what is following and watching them in the woods? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oy, what a mess this film was! It was a shame, because for one, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film. It suffers from two major flaws, and they\&#39;re probably both writer/director Jonas Quastel\&#39;s fault--this film (which I\&#39;ll be calling by its aka of Sasquatch) has just about the worst editing I\&#39;ve ever seen next to Alone in the Dark (2005), and Quastel\&#39;s constant advice for the cast appears to have been, &#34;Okay, let\&#39;s try that again, but this time I want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The potential was there. Despite the rip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib The Blair Witch Project (1999) and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing Predator (1987)), Ed Wood-like exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts. The monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes. The mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if Quastel and fellow writer Chris Lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. The monster\&#39;s &#34;lair&#34; had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it\&#39;s a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, he thinks it\&#39;s a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, he doesn\&#39;t care whether scenes were shot during the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc. He just cuts to them at random. For that matter, the scenes we\&#39;re shown appear to be selected at random. Important events either never or barely appear, and we\&#39;re stuck with far too many pointless scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, or it needs to just be cut out, because it\&#39;s not that important (the monster\&#39;s intelligence and &#34;humanity&#34; could have easily been shown in another way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, there is a whole character--Mary Mancini--left in the script even though she\&#39;s superfluous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, characters keep calling Harlan Knowles &#34;Mr. H&#34;, like they\&#39;re stereotypes of Asian domestics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, Quastel insists on using the &#34;Blurry Cam&#34; and &#34;Distorto-Cam&#34; for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume doesn\&#39;t look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else other than bad cinematography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on, but you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this film better than I did\xc2\x97I\&#39;m a Henriksen fan, I\&#39;m intrigued by the subject, I loved the setting, I love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level--but I just couldn\&#39;t. Every time I thought it was &#34;going to be better from this point until the end&#34;, Quastel made some other awful move. In the end, my score was a 3 out of 10.&#39;
b&#34;So many people loved this movie, yet there are a few of us IMDb reviewers who found Mirrormask excruciatingly uncomfortable to watch and arse-clenchingly boring. I fall into the latter of these two camps, and I will try to explain what it was that made my toenails curl so unpleasantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, to set the record straight - I like Neil Gaiman&#39;s books. I sometimes find his knowing, sarcastic, &#39;wry asides&#39; humour a little geeky, and I actually prefer his work when he is playing it straight and leaving the jokes alone - but, even with his occasional lapses into crap &#39;dad&#39; gags, I find his creativity and imagination to be something a bit special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, one of Gaiman&#39;s strongest works is Coraline, a Gothic fairy story for kids that is very low on jokes and high on tension and creepiness. His latest novel (Anansi Boys) overdoes the funnies, and tends to read at times like Terry Pratchett does the Sisters of Mercy (not the nuns but the band). Mirrormask inhabits similar territory to Coraline, and when I saw the stunning visuals in the trailer, I got a bit excited that somebody had managed to transfer Gaiman&#39;s spectacular vision and imagination to the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In praise of the film, some sequences do look stunning. However, the visual effects are occasionally ruined by CGI animation that looks like a Media Studies student project. Backgrounds and scenery are often incredible, but some of the character animation looks clumsy, amateur and cheap. In an early dream sequence, the spider is animated beautifully, but the book-eating cat-beast looks poorly rendered and very &#39;computer generated&#39;. Compared with the standard of animation found in productions such as &#39;The Corpse Bride&#39;, Mirrormask occasionally looks very amateur indeed. However, in Mirrormask&#39;s defence, the budget was tiny for such a grand vision, and a few creaks in the effects can be understood and forgiven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What cannot be forgiven is the stilted, stagy, cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. The actors struggle desperately with the dialogue - and there is so much of it that they are constantly hampered and stumbling over it. Conversation is rendered completely unnatural, the jokes fall flat time and time again, and the turgid speeches appear to be the writer&#39;s only method of plot exposition. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which always adds an element of &#39;Phantom Menace&#39;) - this renders the film almost unwatchable. In such an unreal setting the actors need to work twice as hard to be believed, and in the main they fail terribly. The girl who plays the lead role puts in a valiant struggle against the impossible stage-school dialogue, and occasionally shows real promise, but it is never enough. The god-awful cod-&#39;Oirish&#39; of the Valentine character (with whom she is forced to spend an inordinate amount of screen time) puts paid to any chance of this young actress rising above the material. It appears to be Valentine&#39;s job to explain the plot to younger viewers, and to add a bit of light relief. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t want him anywhere near my 15 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else is wrong with this film? Answer....Rob Brydon. What&#39;s annoying (for us Brits, anyway) is we know Rob Brydon can act! We&#39;ve seen him hold the screen for half-an-hour on his own (doing those &#39;Marion &amp; Geoff&#39; monologues), and in the first &#39;real world&#39; bit of the film he is fine. However, stick him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and turns into the worst am-dram-ham I&#39;ve seen in years. A real shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else is wrong? Answer... the wanky slap-bassing, sub-Courtney Pine saxing and unlistenable, too-high-in-the-mix soundtrack that never shuts up. God, the music is incessant, loud, distracting, irrelevant and, if that isn&#39;t enough, has wanky slap bass wanking all over it. It makes the dialogue very hard to hear, but that could be a blessing in disguise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else is wrong with it? Answer.... The whistling mime artist. In modern society there should be no place for mime, apart from certain secret places in France. Every moment the camera lingers on the gurning, whistling, moss-juggling, yogurt-weaving idiot, I understand why the Edinburgh locals get a bit anxious and fractious when Festival time comes round again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final criticism is that the film is pretty dull. Surrealism often is dull \xc2\x96 it either requires its audience to slip into a dreamlike, Zen, accepting state, or for the audience be constantly wowed by bigger and grander surprises. A story with a bit of pace involving characters that we could believe in and care about would have gone a long way to giving this film the emotional centre that it sadly lacked, whilst stopping the eyelids from drooping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, apologies to all those who found depth, meaning and wonder in this film. You have managed to suspend your disbelief, you have seen past the creaky CGI, ignored the crappy dialogue and the abysmal performances that resulted, and understood the maker&#39;s grand, imaginative vision. I wanted to, but I couldn&#39;t see past the real-world failings that dragged it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Neil Gaiman gets it right next time, if he gets (or even wants) the opportunity.&#34;
b&#34;Some people say this show was good in it&#39;s early years! I disagree with all of &#39;em. The show is just plain stupid and pathetic. My mum hates it, I hate it, my dad hates it, I don&#39;t know about my sister but oh well. Here some reasons why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. THE CHARACTERS: Babies being used as grown up style characters are stupid. The babies are just precocious and annoying. The grown ups and adults are dumb and unappealing. The worst character is that Angelica Pickles (she really does it in for your ear drums when you had a long, hard and miserable day at the office) and also that Kimi Finster who appears later on; she is too over optimistic and a pain in the butt. She can&#39;t decided whither she is French or Japanese: it doesn&#39;t matter know; you are a American Citizen know and that&#39;s that! Oh, what am I talking about, all the characters from this show suck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. THE STORIES: The stories are unoriginal and dumb. The make it like the babies go off on a great adventure, yeah to the back yard shed. In one episode, that little goofy brat, Tommy Pickles the Leader broke in to a television&#39;s control room and literally almost destroyed it. Don&#39;t give kids any idea to smash up normal T.V Station&#39;s control rooms (they pay a awful lot of money for them in real life). I can imagine what the broadcasters must of felt like airing this episode, they will probably start staring at their machines throughout the day scared that a baby will brake in. Sad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. OVER RATED!: The show has been dragging on for years now and people are still making up stories and new series and spin-offs for this. Get off! The Simpsons have been going for nearly the same amount of time as this but they are much better and funnier than babies. The show is just plain over rated! People, where is your common sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I surprised T.V Stations across the world want to air this series even off today. The show is utter junk and should have never been produced. The two movies for this cartoons sucked just the same! 2/10&#34;
b&#34;Two things -- too long and totally lacked credibility. This movie didn&#39;t make any sense and was excrutiating to sit through. I am usually pretty patient, but man... It just doesn&#39;t keep your attention at all! I think I am being nice here even! You keep thinking it&#39;s almost over only to find out it&#39;s still got another half hour! Good actors.&#34;
b&#39;You know, I was very surprised when watching this movie. It aired during the day once when i was sick, and having nothing else to do, I continued watching. This is by far the WORST MOVIE EVER! But to my surprise I kept watching. I sat there saying, this is terrible, but yet didn\&#39;t change the channel because I was so amused at how bad it was. Maybe It was the guy that looked like Big tom from survivor or the dreadful moustaches and mohawks these characters had, that kept me watching. However, the girls weren\&#39;t half bad, but if that\&#39;s what you want, there is far better. Oh, and there\&#39;s &#34;NINJAS&#34; and &#34;PAJAMA BOYS!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you like ninja\&#39;s, bad acting, hilarious(and terrible) dialogue, and two twins who are five feet tall and killing everything in their sight, then this movie is for you. It\&#39;s so bad it\&#39;s good. However, I just had to give it a 1 out of ten. I couldn\&#39;t have put a 10 on it up there with Lord of the Rings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!!!!!!!!! :)&#39;
b&#34;I&#39;ve got to say, I&#39;m a big fan of these &#39;Last House on the Left&#39; rip-offs, even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high esteem by me; but one of these sorts of films that I didn&#39;t like much was Aldo Lado&#39;s &#39;Night Train Murders&#39;, and unfortunately it would seem that trains and The Last House on the Left don&#39;t mix, as Terror Express is another lacklustre rip-off. Something that this sort of film really needs is a resoundingly nasty lead character; and while Terror Express offers up three potential candidates, not one of them steps up and becomes this villain, leaving the lacking in the most important area. It actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board. This leads the audience to believe that there is more in store, but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set. From there, the trio end up &#39;taking over&#39; the train and use their new found power to terrorise the guests and rape the women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has to be said that there&#39;s a fair amount of sleaze in this film, which will be pleasing to many viewers; but there&#39;s hardly any blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he may have gotten away with it too; if he could film a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex, as the people that you would expect to be powerful and forceful seem all too keen to show their women a good time, and despite one very tame &#39;sandwich&#39; sequence, none of the sex is particularly interesting. Since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes, this becomes a massive problem. Films like this are often lacking in style, suspense and credibility; but you know you&#39;re watching a bad one when it&#39;s boring you. As you might expect, none of the acting is up to anything; and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish. The direction is lacking in style, and there&#39;s very little tension or suspense; making it difficult to care what is going to happen. Overall, this is a pretty crappy example of an exploitation film, and I can&#39;t recommend it.&#34;
b&#34;Wow...not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t believe people dig this trash. Most of the shows on television are pretty bad, and this has been a running trend for a while now - they just keep getting worse, but Las Vegas definitely takes it home. What a terrible show...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors are a bunch of has-been C+ losers that never went anywhere (except James Caan...who knows what he was thinking when he signed on to this pos) so its not their fault that this show sucks. They just can&#39;t help it. Blame the producers and the writers. I can&#39;t believe they shot this and were actually proud enough of their work to air it.&#34;
b&#34;I will not spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the hideous plot lines, I&#39;ll just say that this movie suffers from poor animation, over acting, obvious tag lines\xc2\x85 these are some of it&#39;s good qualities. if you are deserted on an isolated island and the only link to civilization you got is this movie throw it to the fish. I can&#39;t tell you how much I&#39;m sorry I saw this horrifying ghastly movie. Speaking of which, this movie supposedly a horror movie cannot be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the movie is the playing capabilities of some of the actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care.&#34;
b&#39;I was prepared to love &#34;Where\&#39;s Poppa&#34;, it features the nexus of Normal Lear sitcom character actors who, when I was growing up, felt like extended members of my raisenette-sized broken nuclear family. How fun it would be to see censor-free Barnard Hughes, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner, and a pre-SNL Garret Morris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas,&#34;Where\&#39;s Poppa&#34; drags. It\&#39;s claustrophobic and plodding, and breaks the cardinal rules of farce, lightness of mood and a fast pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot involves the efforts of a lawyer (George Segal) to rid himself of his overbearing Jewish mother, who lives in his gigantic New York apartment. Along the way we are exposed ridiculous characters and situations: a comedic group of muggers who repeatedly mug the brother of the main character, the rape of a policeman which involving a gorilla suit and subsequent gay love, Ruth Gorden pulling down Segal\&#39;s pants and biting his ass as he serves her dinner. Why doesn\&#39;t this work? Part of the explanation is the sense of doom engendered by the cramped, dark interiors and antique set-decoration. I absolutely eat up cinematography of New York during this era, but watching this movie felt like I was leafing through the Police Gazette in a dark bus terminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason though is the slow pace. Modern MTV-style quick cuts have changed what moviegoers feel is a comfortable editing tempo, but, even taking this into consideration, camera shots are held for an excessively long time. Plot developments are also very slow. There is one situation in which this works: a weird love song George Segal sings to Trish Van Devere, softly, very close to her face, and for an excruciatingly long period of time. It reminded me of those cringeworthy extended shots in the British version of &#34;The Office&#34;, where you find yourself mentally begging the camera to cut away, and at the same time you can\&#39;t stop looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, most of the film is more &#34;hurry up&#34; than &#34;can\&#39;t look away&#34;. Which made me wonder if it\&#39;s possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce. The dilemma is that the gravitas of the subject matter in a black comedy tends to weigh down lightness of the farce. Movies like Robert Altman\&#39;s &#34;M*A*S*H&#34; and Kubrick\&#39;s &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34; prove that it can be accomplished. They do this not only through speed but also through entertaining subplots, something &#34;Where\&#39;s Poppa&#34; neglects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the film features multiple, stereotypically-funny characters, almost all of them are directly involved in the central drama of how to deal with the recalcitrant mother. The scenes featuring Garret Morris and the Central Park muggers are as close as the viewer gets to a mental break. The muggers seemed almost Shakespearean, following the tradition of comic ne\&#39;er-d0-wells. If the rest of &#34;Where\&#39;s Poppa&#34; had clung a little more closely to stage tradition it would have been a better film. Edgier isn\&#39;t always better. It\&#39;s as if all these talented actors and the director Carl Reiner, were taking a short before the creative maelstrom of the 70\&#39;s .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random notes: After strealing Ron Liebman\&#39;s clothes, the muggers mention Cornel Wilde\&#39;s &#34;The Naked Prey&#34; (1966), a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor to 1968\&#39;s &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As politically incorrect as he was, it\&#39;s disquieting to learn about the death of an action hero as formidable as Charleton Heston. Linda Harrison, who played &#34;Nova&#34;, Taylor\&#39;s mute mate, said that James Fransicus, in the sequel seemed to be cute and tiny compared to Heston.&#39;
b&#39;This is my first Almodavar film. I\&#39;ll confess we chose it mainly because we knew this had the enticing prospect of Antonio Banderas in gay sex scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that is about all that this film has to recommend it. I consider myself a fairly sophisticated viewer, I like European films, &#34;art&#34; films, and I am generally able to recognize a quality film even if it is not to my particular taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this film was a complete blank to me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called it a &#34;hilarious comedy&#34; but I didn\&#39;t laugh once. Loosly and awkwardly constructed, with a lot of pointless dialogue. I don\&#39;t get this at all-- it seems like an amateurish effort. Can someone enlighten me?&#39;
b&#39;Some people thought this was funny because they loved the political issues discussed in this piece. I, however, am so tired of the state of the two party system in our country that I can\&#39;t stomach propaganda from either side. I was hoping for a horror show, but got &#34;cute&#34; zombies and partisan bull crap. I watch my horror films to be scared. This didn\&#39;t even attempt to be scary. Also, this doesn\&#39;t have the wit of Romero in his political/cultural satire laced in his movies...this was a blatant, no-imagination story that was hard for me to stomach (for the wrong reasons). On the bright side, if you hate Bush...you\&#39;ll love this (I\&#39;m not condoning hate or Bush with this statement)&#39;
b&#34;Yeah, I made it all the way to the end. It was pretty hard though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I was wondering if there was even a director on set. The acting...well, I don&#39;t even know what to say. I thought the girl who played Emily tried her best with the boring, sometimes wacky and sometimes predictable dialog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that it was low budget but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look and sound like a 100-minute-long audition tape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not even going to talk about the ending...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about the movie was the music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Even for lesbians who don&#39;t have many movies to watch overall, this is nothing to waste your time on. If you&#39;re looking for a sad lesbian themed movie, check out The Children&#39;s Hour, Lost and Delirious or High Art. Those will all leave you depressed and gloomy but you won&#39;t have to suffer cinematic hell in the process.&#34;
b&#39;This &#34;remake&#34; is a complete disgrace: so mediocre, cheap and prosaic, it wouldn\&#39;t deserve more than a couple of spiteful lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s also a cheat, with a laughable script served by such contrived and amateurish &#34;acting&#34;, you\&#39;re always aware there\&#39;s a set, a camera, a fake, no direction, no suspended reality whatsoever to allow you delve into the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claustrophobic, stifling tension of the small spaces and rooms in the original Japanese masterpieces (Ju-On 1 &amp; 2) is all but lost here in overblown sets and spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But worst of all, the moral enormity and unbearable suffering, which both imparted a ruthless logic to the original mother and child victims turned into relentlessly vindictive ghouls, is completely ruined by utter nonsense and hollow boogie-man style scares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If American audiences aren\&#39;t willing to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator, preferring to swallow this kind of patronizing hogwash instead, they fully deserve this pathetic curse: the movie itself.&#39;
b&#34;I completely understand WHY this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump-factor....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#39;t understand is why THIS movie was made... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to reprise his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DON&#39;t READ ON. The film is absolutely horrible. It&#39;s so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a non-issue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to truly enjoy the film is to set your watch and leave the theatre exactly two hours into the film, because up until that point, it&#39;s quite an interesting thriller. The reparte between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances by the other characters are pretty good. But literally at the two hour mark, the film degrades into nothing but a cheesy D-grade horror flick...it&#39;s sick, and it&#39;s stupid and almost like the crew ran out of filming time, and threw together an ending in one day of filming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial buzz over the Thomas Harris&#39; book&#39;s unsatisfying and bizarre ending led director Ridley Scott to order a re-write... and, honestly, having seen the film AND read the book&#39;s finale, I don&#39;t know which is worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please - don&#39;t waste your money OR time on this film, unless you&#39;re prepared to leave EXACTLY at the two hour point, because that&#39;s the ONLY way you&#39;ll feel satisfied about the saga of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter... continuing the mystery that made the first film, and the wait for this one, so great.&#34;
b&#39;While the new Pride &amp; Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen\&#39;s Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early 1790\&#39;s, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets\&#39; Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home. Scenes are re-set from the novel,and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. For example, the film puts the big Darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a Neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside the Collins\&#39; parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total, if brutal honesty to each other in this scene, the Collinses have never shared an honest word. Why the rain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama, one expects her to cry, &#34;Heathcliffe&#34; at any minute! Austen has been Bronteized! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another favorite of mine from MI-5 on A&amp;E; in P&amp;P, however, he is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiling--though Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust.And much of Austen\&#39;s dialogue is changed to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it deviates from Jane Austen\&#39;s novel so much that any student who watched it, thinking she could substitute viewing for reading, would fail!&#39;
b&#39;I completely forgot that I\&#39;d seen this within a couple of days, which is pretty revealing in itself. The umpteenth version of Gaston \&#39;Phantom of the Opera\&#39; Leroux\&#39;s locked-door country-house mystery, I had heard that it was an engaging and witty update. So it appeared from the likable title sequence and a few neat touches in the opening scene, but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely tedious and wholly unsatisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mystery the major problem is that it is fundamentally unsolvable by the audience: like the worst Agatha Christies, it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a wealth of background information that we have not been privy to. As a film, be it comedy or thriller, the crucial problem is that characterisation is almost non-existent. With the exception of the killer, everyone is a face-value version of the typical suspects in the typical country-house murder story - reporter, endangered heiress, suspicious fianc\xc3\xa9, scatterbrained scientist father (a surprisingly poor Michel Lonsdale), etc. There\&#39;s no depth and little of interest, and the frequently over-ripe or misjudged performances don\&#39;t help. You frankly don\&#39;t care about anyone in it, so there\&#39;s no jeopardy or suspense. Only Claude Rich and, in the last reel, Pierre Arditi get anything to work with, and only in the last reel does the film get close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the rest, we get endless exposition and a couple of ineffective would-be comic set pieces (a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought through to pay off), with Dennis Podalydes reduced to Irving the Explainer for the last third of the picture. I\&#39;m not fond of country-house movies or Agatha Christie style whodunits, so those who are might cit it a lot more slack, but I found it a poor show. As Rich says when the mystery is revealed, &#34;It\&#39;s all rather something of a disappointment.&#34;&#39;
b&#34;It&#39;s hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic. It certainly can&#39;t be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the limpid acting of an all-star cast. These days it&#39;s shown much too frequently on Fox Movie Channel or AMC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It pains me to report that veteran actors like Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty, none of which rings true. It&#39;s like watching an expensive budget being spent on a Saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog. It&#39;s a comic book version of the Jules Verne novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maturing Fontaine was still attractive but wears a pained expression on her face, perhaps regretting that she had accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the script. She contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard role but an imperial and uncomfortable presence and looks totally out of place most of the time. Faring no better are Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and--most of all, Peter Lorre--as well as Frankie Avalon, who gets to sing the title tune which--it&#39;s safe to say--did not become anyone&#39;s favorite title tune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An awfully frustrating experience to sit through a film like this which wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost anyone&#39;s intelligence. Totally unconvincing from start to finish. The film, as well as the fantastic submarine, sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus brings the film to a dreary conclusion.&#34;
b&#34;The movie is an adaptation of a Japanese story by the respected author Yukio Mishima. It simply doesn&#39;t make the transition into a credible story about Brits and Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story moves sluggishly, especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ship&#39;s prow cutting through the waves, and the little route line filling in on the maps, while their letters are heard in overvoice. The film moves so languidly that I even fast-forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which, although long, are not really either passionate or erotic. The film did achieve a measure of notoriety when Kristofferson&#39;s then-wife divorced him for extra-curricular activities with Miss Miles during the filming. I guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it isn&#39;t quite the same for a viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no characters to hang on to. The sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable, the little kid is detestable. Kristofferson is amiable enough, but he just doesn&#39;t have the acting skills to bring much to the role, although perhaps we don&#39;t really want get too involved with him, considering his ultimate fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the little kid, well, he kinda falls in with a bad crowd after his dad dies, and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his mum&#39;s life. Now this is a really bad crowd. They don&#39;t just shoplift and smoke dope, nosireebib. They slip a mickey to a cat and vivisect it. This is shown in gory detail. But of course, this is only practice so they can do the same thing to Kristofferson!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the movie mostly moves slowly, with no characters to relate to, and when something does happen it is unrelentingly morbid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you&#39;ll ever see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all might have made some sense if the Japanese locale and cultural context had been retained. As it stands, it is just abysmal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#34;I watched this movie last night, and let me say, it&#39;s the absolute worst thing I have ever seen. The entire film is a train wreck, and it&#39;s not the actors. It is the horrible script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Spoilers ** Alright, Eddie loses his job to a monkey. His nerdy son is disappointed. The bathroom goes crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He gets a free vacation. He goes along with Uncle Nick and the original Audry. Their boats crashes. They stay on an island. They are stupid and don&#39;t even bother to look at the nearby hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so that&#39;s that. What makes this movie pathetic is the humor. It is so horrid, hillybillyish, and stupid, you can&#39;t even laugh. ANd it&#39;s not stupid funny humor either. I couldn&#39;t laugh the entire thing.&#34;
b&#39;As I write this, no user reviews are in yet, but there are 17 votes with a 4.8 average, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. I didn\&#39;t notice any, and even if I had I don\&#39;t think I could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science, police tactics, and the like so common in B movies should detract significantly from one\&#39;s enjoyment. I tend to fall into the &#34;Yes, that\&#39;s a reasonable reaction&#34; camp -- especially when the mistakes are central to the plot. With this movie, I look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess. They completely botch pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense, and human behavior (outside of B movies, that is.) In short, I can\&#39;t think of any non-trivial thing they got right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit, impervious to all small arms, able to disappear into another dimension at will, and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion. (They don\&#39;t make ghosts like they used to.) Combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a memorably bad movie.&#39;
b&#34;Divorced single mom in picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur into action her dormant love life. Pet project for actress/co-producer Kate Capshaw, who gives a warm, nicely-modulated lead performance, yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so erratic that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in. Initially, Capshaw&#39;s Helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her (an interesting visual joke) but the first person they do this ploy with is Ellen DeGeneres, who doesn&#39;t play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick. Different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick, and the continuity is extremely choppy. Supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who mostly acts with his shirt off) is very good, but they can&#39;t save the final act, which is disappointing. Low-keyed, in a quirky, pleasant way, but it is blandly good-natured, nothing more. **1/2 from ****&#34;
b&#34;Michael Caine might have tried to make a larger than life character to a successful degree but the whole storyline and Character&#39;s around him where not likable or interesting at all. It was all very Boring and somewhat predictable. Martin Landau , a favorite actor of mine had a nothing role.He was useless. Michael Caine got a bit irritating after a while and the film couldn&#39;t decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller. Caine tries hard and good on him but i felt the direction and storyline let him down. Don&#39;t waste your time. It starts off well for the first 10 minutes and then that&#39;s about it. A film for Die Hard Caine Fans Only. Stay away from this One...&#34;
b&#39;My mother forced me to watch this movie with her. She apparently will watch anything with a vampire counsel in it. I was bored throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At different points, Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans is reminiscent of Spartacus, Battle For The Planet Of The Apes, The Passion Of The Christ, and Mandingo! What it reminds me most of are those Italian sword and sandal pictures of the nineteen-sixties (not the good ones) that spend an inordinate amount of time showing Greek or Roman despots in robes talking and plotting incessantly while you wait impatiently for the muscle man hero and his lover, usually the despots daughter, to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was in desperate need of some color and suspense. The characters were pretty two-dimensional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sets looked as if they were constructed entirely of pewter! I wonder how many Civil War Chess Sets were melted down to make this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All those wearing fishnet stockings on your arms and black lipstick, feel free to click NO.&#39;
b&#39;This filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell -- and did so. Really awful jumble of unlikely/unexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line, all without character or clear motivation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get clich\xc3\xa9 snapshots instead of characters. One in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss, who projects an overdone &#34;tough guy&#34; persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her. Nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase (as in, the smallest from a complete American Tourister set) in a bright, sky blue, without explanation or apology. Otherwise it\&#39;s standard visually -- one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in CT.&#39;
b&#34;I am really at a loss as to how anyone could give this movie a 10 (or even more than a 2!). It is full of bad lines, bad acting, bad slapstick, etc. I never thought I could see worse acting than the purposefully badly acted scenes at the beginning of UHF, but this was it. And just when you think it can&#39;t possibly get any worse, it does! Over and over again! You actually could have watched this in a theater? It wasn&#39;t worth free on TV! My 4-year-old and 1-year-old liked it some, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on.&#34;
b&#39;I started watching this because i thought it was a really shitty porno. As i kept watching the only thrill i got from this movie was finding out what the name of it was so i could look it up and rip on it. I just finished it and have considered ending my life knowing that someone actually made this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the people who commented on this movie as having a good script and great acting, my words of wisdom for you are that you probably have no friends because you were in the movie. You are probably wishing you had all that time back of your life that you wasted on making this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way that this is a serious movie. There was an old guy that gets stabbed and it doesn\&#39;t even hurt him at all. And when everyone else gets stabbed they drop dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was probably important that these people killed random people and ate them and also hung out with an 80 year old man that wanted to put the parts into his body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part was when the old man found the &#34;hemoglobens&#34; or however you spell it because that made the movie seem very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really blew my mind that they decided to throw in that random scene about the college girls going into the woods looking for fake skulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do attempt to see this movie, you should probably fill up your bathtub and drop your hairdryer in it and be ready to jump in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A MUST SEE!!!....for anyone who believes there life could not get any worse because this will help you realize there are people out there(the makers of this movie) who are even more pathetic and are going no where in life.&#39;
b&#39;Gave it two stars because the DVD cover was good enough to make me buy this piece of horse manure. I paid a dollar for it at the local DVD exchange and I want my money back. I have a couple of good movies(at least I think they\&#39;re good) that have never seen the inside of a video store. After seeing this, I\&#39;m really insulted by that. Light years worse than anything I\&#39;ve ever seen, I can\&#39;t even recommend this as a campy joke movie. It is so bad, instead of making you laugh it makes you angry. How did this awful film find any kind of distro? I can only believe it was self distributed as the amateurish DVD authoring would suggest. To the producers of this &#34;movie&#34; get out of the business, it\&#39;s obvious you have no talent for it.&#39;
b&#34;I found Code 46 very disappointing. I thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a movie but found that it didn&#39;t deliver. Code 46 lacked thought and structure and the storyline didn&#39;t flow well. I thought that Tim Robbins character wasn&#39;t well developed, for eg. I thought there should have been more info and thought put into his family life and not have it completely ignored as i felt it was. When they were first in violation of a code 46 it was suggested that they were not to know that they may have been genetically linked but all the technology was available to them, he took her fingerprint and therefore genetic details when he was investigating the fraud. I constantly found myself waiting for something to happen and the story line to develop and yet it never did. I felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating but turned out to be the opposite. Code 46 tried to be too clever and in the end just ended up lacking imagination.I would not recommend this film to anybody, the only good thing about the film was that it was relatively short.&#34;
b&#39;I don\&#39;t get it. I just don\&#39;t get it. &#34;Barney and Friends&#34; has been lambasted by millions through the years, and I will admit, I was one of those lambasters. Any child who watches this show doesn\&#39;t realize that what they\&#39;re watching is just a piece of trash. Barney is very annoying, and very selfish. Add Baby Bop, and it gets even worse. Add B.J., then you have a very creepy television nightmare. Then, you get the children. They\&#39;re old enough to know what Barney is trying to teach them! What are they doing there in the first place? It would be funny if Barney and his friends appeared on the Jerry Springer show. That would certainly be one of the wildest moments in television history! Even more significant is that this show marked the beginning of the end of public television as we knew it, as we have seen less and less of the more informational and interesting public television programs that aired in the 1970s and the 1980s. What a BIG difference a selfish son of a gun makes. When this show leaves PBS, a big sigh of relief will be felt among millions of people, but a huge dent will have been made in the annals of television history. A message to Barney himself: You may not realize it, but YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, there are other choices. Better choices.&#39;
b&#39;Three young college women, Simona (Iva Krajnc), Alja (Tanja Potocnik), and Zana (Pia Zemljic), go on an adventure canoing down the River Kolpa, dividing their Slovenia from neighboring Croatia, in this 2002 Slovenian film by Maya Weiss. What could have been an Eastern European version of the well-known and exciting 1972 &#34;Deliverance&#34; turned out, for me, to be utterly uninspiring with flat character portrayals that denied sympathetic identification with the characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alja and Zana are not convincing as students at all, though Alja expresses a desire to be a writer, and both use what seemed to me to be excessive bad language. Alja is bored with her boyfriend and seems to just be drifting along in life. Zana, even less scholarly, is a self-absorbed adventure seeker with an attraction to other women. I had some sympathy with relatively innocent Simona, conservative and starry eyed. The very idea of these three traveling together just doesn\&#39;t work for me. The disdain that Zana and Alja show toward Simona makes no sense - why would they choose her as a travel companion to start with as surely they must know her demeanor and attitudes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three begin a carefree journey down the river on two canoes, undeterred by a news story of a woman\&#39;s disappearance along the river. Things become more somber with the mysterious appearance, sometimes real and sometimes possibly hallucinatory, of a rabidly conservative fisherman politician (Jonas Znidarsic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did enjoy the scenes along the river and of small villages the trio visit. It may be because of a lack of cultural understanding, but the film didn\&#39;t move me otherwise. I was surprised to see that the film has won some awards.&#39;
b&#39;I actually trawled through the entire set of reviews, searching for the ones which gave this film less than 5 stars. They were few and far between. Which is utterly baffling! Yes, I know it\&#39;s a Disney film and it isn\&#39;t directed by Christopher Nolan, but good Lord. This is straight-to-the-bargain-bucket nonsense. They should\&#39;ve had done with it and animated the bloody thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what\&#39;s even worse is the fact that IMDb won\&#39;t let me simply finish my rant there, because my review needs to be longer! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;Awesome&#34; in-game camera shots are LITERALLY taken from Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf on the Playstation, the story plods like a sulking school boy, the multi-stranded character and plot development cripples an already weak setup, and the grand finale is plain boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, it really was the greatest film I\&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good, authentic-looking costumes, sets and sports equipment. There, I said it.&#39;
b&#34;i am amazed anyone likes this film. i never walk out of movies, but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster. the white characters are saints and the Asian characters are practically nonexistent and worthless to the story. they exist only as objects, surprise. characters of other races fare much better. the twists and turns were laughable and predictable. but if you&#39;re reading this, you know that already. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can&#39;t even do multicultural movies right. do yourself a favor and watch a much more honest take on race relations, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle!&#34;
b&#39;My bad film guru (and the president of the Exposed Film Society) sprang this one on us last week. There was no denying the demented gleam in his eye as he pulled it out of its brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us: &#34;The Most Dangerous Game&#34;, filmed on a budget of about $2.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, $2.95 went a lot further back in 1962, but still...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there is certainly a lot to dislike about this film. It abounds with serious technical gaffes (my favorite was the \&#39;repeating musket\&#39; that fired twice in two minutes without benefit of a reload). The hero is a wuss who stands by while his wounded friend fights the henchman and gets killed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More? OK -The plot is a shambles with no continuity to speak of. The movie wastes five minutes with a \&#39;special guest star\&#39; who serves as the physical embodiment of the villain\&#39;s madness and paranoia, but never shows him again. The hero is choked unconscious by the henchman but makes no mention of it when he wakes up and first meets his host. The mute servant girl is captured, put on the rack...and then the movie (and the hero, who put her in this predicament) just sort of &#34;forgets&#34; about her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More? Well, the sets are cheap, and the special effects are cheaper (the makeup is an exception to this). Much of the plot is carried by the narrator\&#39;s droning, monotonic voice-over, which carries less dramatic impact than the menu recital at Denny\&#39;s. Most of the dialog is simply ridiculous and stilted , as if it was translated from Japanese. (&#34;I demand that our conversation be pleasant!!!&#34;) And the color values tended to shift violently from shot to shot, as if cheap film stock and problematic lighting equipment were the order of the day. (Note - this last may have been the fault of a bad print, rather than the camera crew). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there were a couple of nice moments here and there. The makeup effects were startlingly good in contrast to the rest of the film, the actors were LOOKED interesting, especially the mute servant girl and the Countess. And in spite of everything, there was a definite creepy atmosphere to be found, very nasty and disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what was the deal with this movie? I thought about it a bit, and realized that director/writer Pat Boyette basically tried to put a story from of the old &#34;EC&#34; horror comics on film. That would account for the stilted dialog, the sketchy character development (in a comic, physiognomy = character even more than in film), the loopy interior logic of the story (&#34;EC&#34; horror stories went out of their way to include a nasty &#34;shock&#34; ending and weren\&#39;t big on psychological realism), the over reliance on the narrative voice (which belongs in captions over the panels), and the interesting makeup effects that mimicked the grisly pictures that the old EC artists did so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I\&#39;d be willing to bet that when Boyette saw his leading man during casting, he instantly saw that the fellow was as close to being the equivalent of the lanky, shambling figures and caved in faces that artists like Johnny Craig and Jack Davis drew as an actual human could be and still exist in the real world.. He used costumes and lighting to emphasize the cartoony aspect of the visuals and turned everyone into living EC comics characters. (See: the leading lady\&#39;s blank beauty, the Count\&#39;s strong bony features, oddly bronze skin and sharp chin, the platinum \&#39;do on the tall, bony black henchman, etc.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would explain the movie\&#39;s failings. Boyette knew how to \&#39;frame\&#39; things, but he didn\&#39;t know how to deal with three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyette knew how to tell a creepy story within the confines of a comics page, but the nuances of film and live actors escaped him. He wouldn\&#39;t be the first person with this problem of course - look at what Joel Schumacher did to &#34;Batman&#34;. But he didn\&#39;t have a big budget to hide behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I\&#39;m imagine that Boyette walked away from this train wreck and probably spent less time thinking about &#34;Dungeon of Harrow&#34;than the folks who post on this film\&#39;s message boards. He did, within certainly vague boundaries, what he set out to do, and you have to respect him for it...even if you don\&#39;t care for &#34;Harrow&#34;.&#39;
b&#39;This may just be the worst movie of all time. Never have I seen such horrible film making before in my life. Its so bad I think I want to go watch Barney instead. I advise everyone who reads this to write a petition to get this movie off of our film history so we can never hear from it again. I give it 1 out of 10.&#39;
b&#34;Being a child of the 1980s, I grew up with numerous educational as well as diversionary programs (or both), and continue to learn so much from them now that I admire the wisdom of those who worked on them. After learning that Sesame Street, to name the best example, was not solely responsible for the fact that I could read at an adult level before I could walk, it only increased the level of disgust I feel not only towards the Lyons corporation and its product, but those who defend them, too. As if I had faith in those we assign to protect us or our children to begin with, the fact that Barney &amp; Friends still pollutes our airwaves after more than a decade later is a discredit not only to the FCC, American commerce, and its makers, it is a discredit to all of humanity. In a world where I can be harassed without recourse by the police, welfare services, and child protection agencies simply for being born different to those in power, yet broadcasters are allowed to pump this drivel into my home uncontested, you have to ask what is wrong with people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, in a world where we are expected to behave like adults and account for ourselves, what we say to our sons and daughters is of importance because it will often have consequences long after we are gone. Not only are our attempts to make our children more normal, more alike, more think-alike, potentially devastating, what we end up teaching them to be normal has a big part to play, too. So the question becomes one of what Barney is teaching our children to be normal. Apart from lessons such as that we are not good if we do not have good feelings, or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we come up short, other shocking things we are shown on the Barney show include Barney molesting children. The issue of child abduction and child molestation is a big one in our society, and has been ever since we started trying to pretend it was not, but that would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways in which to present the topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaging lessons Barney himself presents. Adding to the problem is the children shown on the show. I use the word children loosely here, as the range of ages shown goes as low as three years and as high as fourteen. Yet no difference in emotional response is shown at either extreme. Fourteen year olds react to Barney and his proposed situations in the exact same way as five year olds. Experts in childhood and adolescent autism especially consider this an incredibly foul thing to expose children to. Adults on the autistic spectrum who faced increasing problems as their needs were not only not met but flat-out ignored have a tendency to watch this and feel an urge to do the kinds of things with Barney that would make fourteen year olds cry. As irreverent and sick as shows targeted toward the elder-child market such as You Can&#39;t Do That On Television were, they stamp all over Barney by demonstrating that not only do different ages respond to the same thing in different ways, so too do different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in response to mdmireles1295, I have to say that I hope like hell they do not have children. For every time I see a parent showing their child this drivel, it gives me an overwhelming urge to report them to the police for child abuse. And I speak as a man whose entire upbringing was dominated by abuse. They might sing about manners, loving, caring, or sharing, but the examples they show are not only so lopsided as to be the opposite of educational, they are so devoid of realism as to become dangerous, as The Light Triton has already pointed out. The kind of lessons children learn from Barney are that people do not vary, feelings must be suppressed at all costs, and rules are entirely arbitrary. When compared to the lessons that variation is what makes the world go around and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television taught me as a boy, it still boggles the mind that the authorities have yet to step in and yank this trash off the air. If a parent did to their child what Barney does around the world, they would face criminal charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, I gave Barney my favourite two out of ten score that I give to all rubbish with absolutely no redeeming value. In a world of adults that know how to properly respond to their children, it has no place.&#34;
b&#34;Maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because I walked out well before the end. That&#39;s odd, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed Midsummers Night&#39;s Dream once, many years ago, when I saw it on the stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the Shakespearian name, Calista Flockhart, and Michelle Feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. Well, I suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren&#39;t, I&#39;d say we have a bad movie on our hands....&#34;
b&#39;This film looks great, and that\&#39;s about where my praise ends. &#34;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&#34; came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955, when candy-coloured nonsense like this co-existed with trail-blazing artistic fair like &#34;Kiss Me Deadly.&#34; As a trend toward smaller, socially conscious films like &#34;On the Waterfront&#34; and &#34;Marty&#34; established itself in the mid-50\&#39;s, other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging, pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade, and &#34;Love&#34; is one of the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the kind of 50\&#39;s movie where the Technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably high-key; even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to hear the theme song again, as it\&#39;s played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime, and I certainly don\&#39;t want to hear it sung by the shrill, ear-piercing choir that belts it out over the end titles. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but really anybody could have played these parts. Jones\&#39; role is horribly written--her character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something, the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People will undoubtedly tell me I\&#39;m taking this film too seriously, that I\&#39;m unromantic, etc. But I loved &#34;All That Heaven Allows,&#34; released the same year and just as cornball in its own way, except that Douglas Sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form, whereas Henry King (director of &#34;Love&#34;) is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m usually able to enjoy bad melodrama, but in this case I was just bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: D+&#39;
b&#34;I attended the premier last night. The movie started out with a bang (perhaps due to pre-premier excitement). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting off sleep. This movie can not be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any of Guest&#39;s work, unless you want to say _Sons of Provo_ is a wanna-be gone awfully wrong. It just fell flat, it died, it was painful. The story went nowhere, the jokes were bland, even if you were a Mormon and could get all of the inside jokes, it felt like a waste of time. There were two redeeming qualities: Kirby&#39;s acting was spot on! And the songs were very clever (for an LDS audience only). So, my recommendations... Avoid the movie. And if you are Mormon, buy the music CD.&#34;
b&#39;End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I\&#39;ve ever seen. Muddling direction, meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes, rapid-fire MTV-style editing and poor acting all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That\&#39;s not to say End of Days isn\&#39;t watchable. The movie kept me interested because I found Ah-nuld\&#39;s latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic. Without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker, which is why End of Days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won\&#39;t go into the details explaining why End of Days violates the law of movie logic, but here are several problems with this movie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(SPOILER)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Devil walks out, the restaurant explodes without any trace as to how he did it. No snapping finger, no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire, nothing. How could this happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arnold and his annoying sidekick Kevin Pollack somehow magically comes up with the name &#34;Christine York&#34; after examining the phrase &#34;Christ in New York&#34; carved on a victim\&#39;s body, runs the database on the computer and, viola, Christine York, the only person with the exact name in all of New York City! Beyond my suspension of disbelief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did the characters who have come in contact with Arnold\&#39;s character turn against him later in the movie? I laughed out loud when I recognized the good-stepmother-turned-evil-stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in William Shakespeare\&#39;s Romeo + Juliet. Her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the mindlessly huge explosions and gunfires. What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Devil took a man\&#39;s body comprising of flesh and blood, yet he\&#39;s invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body. Logically, this is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment, Arnold\&#39;s character runs into the solid Christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and *falls on it* physically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Devil is capable of punching the person\&#39;s brains out and twisting a victim\&#39;s head 180 degree, yet he could not kill Arnold\&#39;s character as he always intends to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How the Devil\&#39;s object of desire\&#39;s parents died and why evil New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire were never explained at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the sequence that\&#39;s a rip-off of Speed, Arnold and the Devil\&#39;s object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed. This is beyond my comprehension, since the force would be enough to throw Arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the Devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall, yet the Devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience\&#39;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of the movie, after the Devil took over a man\&#39;s body, all of a sudden Arnold is his bodyguard??? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arnold\&#39;s recital of cringe-inducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like &#34;YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO ME!&#34; are the perfect fodder for MST3K, just as Eraser did with the classic line &#34;You\&#39;re the luggage!&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ludicrous. So are the pseudo-religious babble about the Christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the Devil\&#39;s object of desire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(END SPOILERS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is highly ironic that End of Days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome, and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. The director\&#39;s indulgence of excess is a factor here. He surely doesn\&#39;t know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, End of Days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness -- Arnold\&#39;s worst since Hercules in New York. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#39;On paper this movie has some chops: a street kid overcoming past trauma, rebuilding his life and succeeding when the world would have written him off. Great stuff, everyone loves a happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the theater though, there were some omissions that left the movie dead inside. The dialog was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost cartoonish in their lack of dimension and complexity, and why did everyone need to be gay? I have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie but when it\&#39;s used in this fashion not only is is offensive to homosexuals, it trivializes the lifestyle and cheapens the movie. If the story works without this cheap trick it should have been cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every character seemed to come out of the same cookie cutter form: Each had one major flaw and one minor flaw, every character is good hearted were they succeed or not, and everyone one of them had or is in an abusive relationship with someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying fact of the movie is that they never let you get over that the name &#34;pip&#34; comes from great expectations. They give it to you once and that should be enough. The story shares enough with the Dickens classic to make this fact obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette he leaves for Pip and how Pip, the main character, learns how to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape. In the end, with lessons learned, Pip confronts his dark past and movies forward with his life.&#39;
b&#39;I am very surprised to see the good ratings for this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched the film 9 years ago and I still remember how angry I felt to sit in the movie theatre and to look at this mess. I am a big fan of John Boorman\&#39;s work. I really like his movies. So I went to &#34;Beyond Rangoon&#34; with big expectations. But I felt like watching a dumb, cheap Chuck Norris jungle movie with all action scenes cut out. Even the soundtrack was very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t believe that John Boorman was the director because this movie was so badly done. I think the Burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle.&#39;
b&#39;This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I have ever seen! I am giving this movie way too much credit! My best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone else\&#39;s martial arts abilities, but realized that you can\&#39;t just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it, so he put a story behind the fighting... and people still didn\&#39;t watch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie\&#39;s story line was onion skin thin. That acting was goofy and stereotypical of any Kung Fu movie. The dubbing was literally the worst I have ever heard. It seemed if you played a small role in this movie, like the fat guy or the two guys trying to catch the main character with a net, it didn\&#39;t matter who over did your voice. It could have been a dyslexic with a slurred stutter and nobody would have said anything. But beside all of this, the movie makes up for itself with the somewhat awesome fight scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fight scenes were definitely what this movie was all about. But the instigations of the fights were totally absurd! On most all instances, a guy either pops out of the tall grass, or glances at the main character from a distance, and then attacks him. But once the fighting started, things sort of balanced out. There were only two things that really hampered the fighting, though. Those constant &#34;wooshing&#34; sound effects that were added to every swing of a fist or foot or sword, and the poor editing that made 25 percent of the fighting VERY jumpy and choppy. Someone would be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly be on the ground being kicked, and then instantly be back on their feet blocking a punch. But while the cut and paste editing was more of a nuisance than anything else, it didn\&#39;t really affect the overall movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this was not a great movie, but I wasn\&#39;t expecting a great movie. A great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movie\&#39;s. All I saw this movie as was a way to pass an hour and a half of boredom. I rarely say that, but this was just one of those movies you have no practical use for, so you watch it whenever you have some free time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Good day gentlemen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Scott-&#39;
b&#34;Rob Lowe must have eaten up the entire budget, but I can&#39;t fault him for running with the money. Even he would have to agree, there was nothing good about this movie. Filming, editing, direction, dialogue, sets, makeup, writing, casting (especially the young girl and imposter child psychiatrist), and the story all were just the worst. I have never seen such a horrible movie. Pass this one up for any other rental selection, or find yourself shouting out vile comments at the TV. Dead Silent should be silenced for all time.&#34;
b&#34;I saw this film before two weeks. It&#39;s kitsch, boring and totally unintelligible for people, that haven&#39;t read the original book. There are many fact mistakes too... actors plays rather poor, you must laugh even in the sad moments. It was a totally waste of time.&#34;
b&#39;This film wasn\&#39;t good at all. I was able to catch it at a film festival and didn\&#39;t appreciate the content I was forced to watch. It\&#39;s a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the family\&#39;s cornerstone (Gabrielle Union) dies. the film stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle\&#39;s Union\&#39;s brother. Well, actually, Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams older sister. This had to be Billy Dee William\&#39;s worst performance in his career, ever. He looked as if he didn\&#39;t remember his lines in a few scenes. He was an unlikable, hardly ever empathetic character, who fathered a daughter while married to a white woman whom he already had a daughter with as well. The two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman (Lucy) was trying to connect with him, his other daughter didn\&#39;t want anything to do with him. Billy Dee\&#39;s character was so pathetic that the only way they can get him to fly in from Paris for his sister\&#39;s funeral was by telling him that the funeral had already passed and his late sister left him with the responsibility of handling her paperwork. Why they had to fool him? Because he didn\&#39;t like attending funerals. I know. You\&#39;re asking, &#34;but he didn\&#39;t want to attend his own sister\&#39;s funeral too?&#34; Yes! He claims he didn\&#39;t like being around the forced feelings of emotions that is shared amongst the people paying their respects. He didn\&#39;t want anything to do with that. Now we\&#39;re suppose to empathize with that a**hole? The rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters. The director and editor didn\&#39;t care to consider the pacing of the film. The flashbacks were painful to watch. It was a bad film. However, it seems to be the favorite at black film festivals; a film that glorifies African-Americans dependence on Caucasians to find a love that they can settle down with, even if it is a healthy relationship. When lame love stories like this win best of festivals at the black film festivals, it makes me question the judgment of black people on film. In these same festivals, the only films that win awards are educational films about African American culture and black films directed by Caucasian directors. I\&#39;m not saying that anything is wrong with a white person directing stories written for people of color. The problems with these films is that they never argue from both point of views, which are usually the films that actually speaks to the masses. These films are often one-sided forms of didacticism. These films fail at executing the powers of both sides of the argument that the film is revolved around. The writers and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. These films always slant the argument. What I am saying is, are the people running these black film festivals judging a film off of pure content, which to me means directing, acting, writing cinematography, editing, etc., or are they judging films off of strictly the message being delivered about African American culture? Are we suppose to expect a film like Constellation to have a shot in the world against films like &#34;Million Dollar Baby&#34; and &#34;Sideways?&#34; What happened to film being entertaining? When I mean entertainment, I mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, staring at the screen, investing tremendous concentration and energy into what one hopes will be satisfying, meaningful emotional experience. Why can\&#39;t these festivals appreciate films that get their messages across without preaching? Why can\&#39;t these black film festivals acknowledge films that are well told pieces of work that are brutally honest, telling the truth? &#34;I believe we have no responsibility to cure social ills or renew faith in humanity, to uplift the spirits of society or even express our inner being. We have only one responsibility: to tell the truth.&#34;--Robert McKee. Now that\&#39;s something I totally agree with. These same black film festivals put down &#34;Hustle and Flo&#34; as if it is that awful film stereotyping blacks. However, it\&#39;s an honest film about a pimp with a dream. A pimp can\&#39;t dream? I recall the last time I saw a real pimp he was a human being. And aren\&#39;t they, pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society at large, not just in the black community but all over? The powers that be in &#34;black Hollywood&#34; believe that films like this are making Afro-Americans look bad in the eyes of others, as if others don\&#39;t know that there are pimps in the hood. The truth is, until African American people in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, then our films will never have a chance in the world. This film was awful. The best thing was the cinematography and Zoe.&#39;
b&#39;Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke. He might, as well, have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. &#34;Kay Hoog&#34; reminds one more than a little of both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow, quintessential man of mystery- and the very first &#34;Dark Knight&#34;- was also thought to be one Kent Allard. If one were to take Savage\&#39;s first name first and add to it the Kent, you end up with- voila- Clark Kent. Funny, innit?) Like Indiana Jones, Hoog isn\&#39;t above pilfering the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his thefts are often more blatant and less &#34;charmingly roguish&#34; than Jones\&#39;s). Unfortunately, this two-parter is a far cry from subsequent serials (from any era) in terms of overall quality. One of the first indications that something is amiss vis a vis the cinematic storytelling is a scene where desperados on horseback, quite literally breathing down his neck, simply watch as Hoog escapes their clutches in a hot air balloon. Why they don\&#39;t bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many movie-making mysteries that plague these two films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second half of this two-parter is even worse than the first. Granted, this was one of the first ever serials and, as such, should be cut a bit of slack- but there are limits, even, to tolerance. (At one point, the capture of the hero is effected not on screen, but in the narration itself! Talk about cutting corners...) Fritz Lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did, THE SPIDERS is a bitter pill indeed to swallow...&#39;
b&#34;Bad dialog, slow story, scenes that drag on and are absolutely pointless. I can&#39;t believe this much money was invested in such a poorly written film. The directing and acting couldn&#39;t save this bomb either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;50% through the movie and you&#39;re still waiting for it to start. They lay the foundation with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes setting up NOTHING. You watch 40 minutes of footage that is absolutely directionless in an attempt to do what, I have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of this film is like watching a really bad french movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just sort of dull, lifeless and egocentrics living without purpose or care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this film at all cost. Anyone that recommends it is setting you up for disappointment and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth.&#34;
b&#39;I saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996. I remember I was already familiar with Elijah Wood\&#39;s work (that\&#39;s right, he made stuff before &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;!) and the merchandising tie-ins to the film were pretty abundant (&#34;Flipper&#34; water guns were even circulating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adults were reminded of the old movies and TV show and for nostalgia\&#39;s sake took their kids to see it, who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it wasn\&#39;t what anyone expected and flopped severely. You know a movie\&#39;s in trouble when a boy swims away from a Hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away, and the kid -- instead of getting out of the water into a boat -- floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he hasn\&#39;t taken into mind that the shark is still out there, perhaps even below him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is Paul Hogan. He looks old, crusty and tired of recycling his Croc Dundee shtick. By now, no one even remembered &#34;Crocodile Dundee&#34; much less Hogan, and I half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn\&#39;t know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fish-out-of-water/social-satire laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a really poor &#34;family&#34; movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times. I hated it when I saw it in theaters back in \&#39;96 and I hate it more now.&#39;
b&#34;Man I loved Ocean&#39;s 11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart movie. All eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What on earth was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume it&#39;s supposed to be Zeta-Jones but she wasn&#39;t really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones&#39; characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With O-11, the gang were always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always able to outsmart him. What happened here? He catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they&#39;re all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier. So next movie they&#39;re going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puh-lease...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 mins of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow moving movie, not the energy of the first one. I tried hard to like it and I&#39;m usually very easy to please but I&#39;m really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER!!! The twist - the whole movie didn&#39;t need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;END SPOILER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait until it comes on TV or if you&#39;re a fan of the original from 2001 please don&#39;t watch this.&#34;
b&#39;Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, Chuck Traynor. I don\&#39;t understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves &#34;civilized&#34; however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.&#39;
b&#39;Is it just me, or is this an AWFUL film? I\&#39;m going with it\&#39;s an AWFUL film...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing full well that it\&#39;s a guy flick (usually defined as full of car chases, crashes, gunfights, explosions, etc.), I still expect some small degree of credibility. If I can\&#39;t somehow believe in the premise, the film WILL NOT WORK. Thus, we come to the problem with &#34;Assault on Precinct 13.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not one for spoilers, I never report details of the plot. However, I will make an exception here, because the plot is SO inane. Bad guy is jailed in Precinct 13. Bad guy\&#39;s buddies want to bust him out. Surprise. The bad guys\&#39; buddies are actually corrupt cops. Brooding, troubled, but heroic young cop saves the day while romancing the girl. UGH. Yes, it really is THAT simple, and that dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Assault on Precinct 13&#34; takes place in Detroit. Not a bad setting for crime and corruption (I spent 3 months there in late 2004, so I know what I\&#39;m talking about). Even so, it\&#39;s outrageously violent and insulting to the police and the citizens of Detroit. I have spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I cannot imagine how the final chase wound up in the downtown Detroit forest. I must have missed it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are NO refunds for watching bad movies. Save your money. There were too many good films in 2005 to waste even $3.00 at Blockbuster on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL RATING: 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Only because I have seen worse films.)&#39;
b&#39;The production values for this film make it fall short of Hollywood blockbuster status, and the script makes it fall short of cult status. What is left is a tired formulaic attempt at the disaster movie genre that will disappear with the ebb tide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent cast, are either miss cast, or cannot be bothered.The beautiful Joanne Whalley is unable to bring any gravitas to the role of Police Commissioner Nash who wears the most irritating matching waist clincher above her skirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessalyn Gilseg plays the heavyweight part of Director of the Thames Barrier with all the conviction of a fairground candy floss. Her Canadian nationality and accent were presumably drafted in to appeal to a transatlantic audience. It, and she, fails.Her initial appearance in a tight fitting pink jogging suit as she arrives at work is risible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part of the &#34;Siren old git who was right&#34; is played by Tom Courtenay as though he is acting in his sleep, and the various plot twists that are designed to energise his son, played by Robert Carlyle, struggle to get any response from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nigel Planer looks determined to commit ritual hari kari for his failings as Met Office Director, or for his acting, or both, and only David Suchet emerges with some credit for his role as Deputy PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was enough in the story, and the cast and the effects to have produced a decent effort. Alas that did not happen.&#39;
b&#34;Strange things happen to Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their young daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, Greg&#39;s real life daughter) when they move into a large, newly inherited house in Ireland. Crusty corpses are found in the cellar, a turkey squirts blood, furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and a cackling old lady show up to scare the little girl. Paranormal investigators are eventually called in to banish the evil spirits, but Maura becomes possessed anyway and chases everyone around with a meat cleaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is full of cliches, but there&#39;s a standout performance from Alexandra Paul... too bad it doesn&#39;t belong in this movie (nor any other I can think of off hand)! She can barely keep a straight face and her over-emoting and hysterical screaming tantrums are a joy to behold. In any case, she&#39;s a lot more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Score: 3 out of 10&#34;
b&#39;I just don\&#39;t understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest metro areas in the country (Houston, Dallas, Austin/San Antonio etc.), they portray the average person as someone who wears wranglers/cowboy hat , talks with a drawl, has zero fashion sense, and drives a truck on his way to either the &#34;saloon&#34; or his next hunting trip, rodeo, skeet shooting or country music concert. I have never even seen a small town cop driving a police-truck...anywhere in Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy...they are actually serious and I guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference. The bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away. This show makes goofy shows in the past like Knightrider look like high-brow entertainment. At least Knightrider had the talking car.&#39;
b&#34;It is is very sad to see someone of the calibre of George C Scott in a low budget thriller which would have been better if the original novel was written by Graham Greene and directed by someone somewhat more experienced in the genre. NOT TO MENTION A BETTER CINEMATOGRAPHER. There are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and carnival merely glossed over, rather than captured to locate the movie solidly in the exotic setting of the novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsewhere in the viewer comments on this site, one very astute observer complained about the variety of diabolically bad accents in this film. Ever since I saw George C Scott as Rochester in Jane Eyre, I have prayed for him NEVER to ever accept again a role which required him to assume a British accent. Just every now and then, he could just possibly pass for British or a very British sounding South African played obviously by an American actor. I can stomach Meryl Streep&#39;s extraordinarily laboured accents (both British and Australian) - at least she gets it right even though with every utterance, she demands that we marvel at her skill. Well, I am sorry that Mr. Scott is no Meryl Streep, and it just destroys the illusion - like having Michele Yeoh speak excruciating Mandarin with a strong Singaporean accent in Crouching Tiger etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peterson acts no differently than what we see on CSI. Except he is still very handsome and more or less slim in this movie. He is the Harrison Ford of TV. Same old expressions for every emotion, every situation. No on second thought, Ford has two - perplexed/pained and happy. I have never seen a smile on Mr. CSI!&#34;
b&#34;First of all, no one with any law enforcement experience (Not ER or EMT, but real law enforcement) takes this show seriously. Walker would be drummed out of any police force in the US for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. On top of that, he is a comic book character---no acting ability, incredibly trite lines, no character development. The fact that Alex Cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are. And Trivett is the ultimate clown in black-face. Come on---if you think Walker is a heartfelt show without bias, then explain why JT is treated as a dolt, always is the subject of Walker&#39;s jokes, never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime, and never rescues Walker, who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does. While it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them (and believe me, most cops are dumber than dirt), the smart ones Walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once Walker is captured, the jerk needs to be put of his misery. But then again, Norris produced the show as well as starred in it, so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are. As if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time. What a terrible series! It is more demeaning than any of the hokey westerns like The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Cisco Kid, and Wild Bill Hickock, though I would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows. But like those shows, in the same way as those shows, Walker TR is just as insulting and just plain silly.&#34;
b&#39;Yes, in this movie you are treated to multiple little snowmen on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously. It is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make. It has its funny moments, but really playing off the cheapness of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me. You can not come up with a good story, your effects are going to really be bad, hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie. The first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort. It also had better effects too, this one is just a step or two ahead of &#34;Hobgoblins&#34; as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets. Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost. Actually, I am just kidding, but really it was the funniest part of the movie.&#39;
b&#39;they should make terrorists watch this video as torture, and not just for the disturbing final scene in which tying up and beating a woman with mental problems is apparently a source of comedy. about a half hour of this would convince even the staunchest fundamentalist to spill the beans rather than sit through even one more minute of this disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is awful. I rented it because a friend said it was hilarious, only to find he was talking about the blowhard director doing the commentary rather than the movie itself. I guess if you find unrestrained arrogance funny, you\&#39;ll like this. It apparently is true that he goes on and on about chicks he\&#39;s &#34;banged&#34;, the most tasteless example being when the lead actress comes on screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually CJ Stacy was the only good part of this movie - her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrid dung pile. This apparently is the only movie she\&#39;s done according to IMDb, I hope she is involved with theatre or indie stuff as I think she has the talent and natural beauty to really be an asset to any production.&#39;
b&#39;What were they thinking when they made this truly TERRIBLE film? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the Twentieth Century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. What possessed anyone to make this film, which explains her unique artistic vision, as being the result of an (imaginary) affair with a grotesque, yet charismatic hairy freak (played by Downey)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In real life, Arbus broke out of a traditional marriage and woman\&#39;s role to express herself. In this movie, Arbus is an ultra-dreary Nicole Kidman whose inspiration is all attributed to a &#34;Beauty and The Beast&#34; devotion to an interesting man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this reinvention, the film is truly shameful. Independent of that, it is also just dopey and dull.&#39;
b&#39;Well, this may be one of the worst movies ever, but atleast there are some nice t*ts in it. The movie is a very bad spoof of The Blair Witch Project, and should be watched only by those wanting to see some t*ts, and NO point other than to flaunt them.&#39;
b&#34;This film is little more than an ersatz Verhoeven. The filming is supposed to be tele-realistic, but is simply sickening. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously. The Brechtian pauses for non-existent advert brakes are tedious, and even painful; undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film Brechtian, it was just an accident which happened like that. If you want to see a parody of reality tv, watch Celebrity DeathMatch - it&#39;s funnier and wittier, and most importantly shorter. I have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film. To be avoided like a rabid rabbit.&#34;
b&#39;Cruddy, innocent..no smoking, drinking or bikers, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this moronically feasible for a bad biker flick, post-biker (exploit) time. They knew it, we knew it...Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted..but they lived on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY really to catch the final exploit biker film after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it. They were trying to make a living. But, Jocelyn Lane (from two Elvis bad flicks, TICKLE ME and something bad one) in yellow and leather is the modern hot chick with J. Slate fighting for honor. It\&#39;s worth seeing, but it sucks. But check it out. Well worth non-biker, non-smoker, non-boozing, &#34;biker&#34; types with hot chicks.&#39;
b&#39;I was rather disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 mins of the film. It was fresh, innovative, and just.....different. I rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those &#34;make you squirm&#34; buttons. Tetsuo did just that where for me, few movies can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air, those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile, Testuo II will likely be a disspointment. If your looking for that visceral &#34;HYPER-KINETIC&#34; feel of the first movie, skip this one, as thats all been stripped away. Tetsuo II is for some odd reason, just a typical Hollywood style action flick. I was rather confused. However, it\&#39;s still worthwhile in my opinion for any die-hard Tsukamoto fan.&#39;
b&#34;this show is pretty alright and fun to watch, its a great Disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons. This show has completely changed around. In the first season it was more about science and animals, all that is gone now in the season and third season. Its more about her life and dating. Ever since that gay kid (Ben) came along, this show has sucked. The writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy. Disney took a turn for the worse. I cant stand to watch the newest episodes anymore, they&#39;re all garbage.&#34;

</blockquote>
<p>So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.</p>
<p><img src="Web App Diagram.svg"></p>
<p>The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.</p>
<p>In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.</p>
<p>Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">Setting up a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.</p>
<h4 id="Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the <strong>IAM</strong> page and click on <strong>Roles</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>AWS service</strong> is the type of trusted entity selected and choose <strong>Lambda</strong> as the service that will use this role, then click <strong>Next: Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>In the search box type <code>sagemaker</code> and select the check box next to the <strong>AmazonSageMakerFullAccess</strong> policy. Then, click on <strong>Next: Review</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>LambdaSageMakerRole</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">Part B: Create a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on <strong>Create a function</strong>. When you get to the next page, make sure that <strong>Author from scratch</strong> is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>sentiment_analysis_func</code>. Make sure that the <strong>Python 3.6</strong> runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on <strong>Create Function</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below.</p>

<p>Once you have copy and pasted the code above into the Lambda code editor, replace the <code>**ENDPOINT NAME HERE**</code> portion with the name of the endpoint that we deployed earlier. You can determine the name of the endpoint using the code cell below.</p>

<p>Once you have added the endpoint name to the Lambda function, click on <strong>Save</strong>. Your Lambda function is now up and running. Next we need to create a way for our web app to execute the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-API-Gateway">Setting up API Gateway<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-API-Gateway">&#182;</a></h3><p>Now that our Lambda function is set up, it is time to create a new API using API Gateway that will trigger the Lambda function we have just created.</p>
<p>Using AWS Console, navigate to <strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> and then click on <strong>Get started</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page, make sure that <strong>New API</strong> is selected and give the new api a name, for example, <code>sentiment_analysis_api</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create API</strong>.</p>
<p>Now we have created an API, however it doesn't currently do anything. What we want it to do is to trigger the Lambda function that we created earlier.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown menu and click <strong>Create Method</strong>. A new blank method will be created, select its dropdown menu and select <strong>POST</strong>, then click on the check mark beside it.</p>
<p>For the integration point, make sure that <strong>Lambda Function</strong> is selected and click on the <strong>Use Lambda Proxy integration</strong>. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.</p>
<p>Type the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the <strong>Lambda Function</strong> text entry box and then click on <strong>Save</strong>. Click on <strong>OK</strong> in the pop-up box that then appears, giving permission to API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function you created.</p>
<p>The last step in creating the API Gateway is to select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown and click on <strong>Deploy API</strong>. You will need to create a new Deployment stage and name it anything you like, for example <code>prod</code>.</p>
<p>You have now successfully set up a public API to access your SageMaker model. Make sure to copy or write down the URL provided to invoke your newly created public API as this will be needed in the next step. This URL can be found at the top of the page, highlighted in blue next to the text <strong>Invoke URL</strong>.</p>

<p>In the <code>website</code> folder there should be a file called <code>index.html</code>. Download the file to your computer and open that file up in a text editor of your choice. There should be a line which contains <strong>**REPLACE WITH PUBLIC API URL**</strong>. Replace this string with the url that you wrote down in the last step and then save the file.</p>
<p>Now, if you open <code>index.html</code> on your local computer, your browser will behave as a local web server and you can use the provided site to interact with your SageMaker model.</p>
<p>If you'd like to go further, you can host this html file anywhere you'd like, for example using github or hosting a static site on Amazon's S3. Once you have done this you can share the link with anyone you'd like and have them play with it too!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Important Note</strong> In order for the web app to communicate with the SageMaker endpoint, the endpoint has to actually be deployed and running. This means that you are paying for it. Make sure that the endpoint is running when you want to use the web app but that you shut it down when you don't need it, otherwise you will end up with a surprisingly large AWS bill.</p>
